# Luke Davis: technical SEO, music producer & creator

## Hello!

I'm a senior technical SEO specialist, music producer, and blogger based in Nottingham, UK.

I currently work for [Impression](https://www.impressiondigital.com/) and I'm also the founder of [NiTEDREAM](https://nitedre.am/) (formerly Pandog Media), [Sampleface](https://sampleface.co.uk), [Cultrface](https://cultrface.co.uk/), [LOGiCFACE](https://logicface.co.uk/), [Playrface](https://playrface.co.uk/), and [Distant Arcade](https://distantarcade.co.uk/).

I love most things technical-related, SEO-related, and Web-related.
