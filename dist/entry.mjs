      <p class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">Hi again.</p>
      <h2 class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">About me</h2>
      <ul class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I love the Web a great deal. I fell down the WWW rabbit hole back in 2000 and got into coding a year later. Via graphic design, mathematics, a music tech degree, and 7 years in customer service, I found myself in digital marketing. I'm now an SEO.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I currently work as a technical SEO and I love SEO.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I've been learning Portuguese since 2017.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I have a son who is my pride and joy.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I've had grey hair since I was 20.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I've lived in 3 different cities in the UK and 1 in the US (Atlanta for 6 months).</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I also love Python, HTML, and CSS. And the Web. Have I already said that?</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I create for people, not algorithms.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">In my spare time, I enjoy watching <a href="/wiki/sport/" class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">sports</a>, playing Pokémon and reliving my childhood with <a href="/wiki/gaming/" class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">old computer games</a> and cartoons on YouTube. I love modernist architecture, Mies van der Rohe, and <a href="/wiki/sport/roger-federer/" class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">Roger Federer</a>.</li>
        <li class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I have a degree in Music Technology and <a href="https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/" class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I've been making music since 2010</a>.</li>
    </ul>
      <h2 class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">About the site</h2>
      <p class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">I’ve had so many versions of this site, I’ve lost count. It originally started life as starcrazy.org back in 2009(?) but eventually, I moved over to lukealexdavis.co.uk in 2010. Since then, it’s taken the form of a blog and a hand-coded personal site with numerous cosmetic changes.</p>
      <p class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">Now, the site is built using <a href="https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro/" class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">Astro</a>, "a new kind of static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a modern developer experience".</p>
      <p class="astro-5ZSQGZ72">My relationship with the Web has influenced how I’ve made and remade this site, from FrontPage Express to Microsoft FrontPage to Dreamweaver to Sublime Text. Other influences include:</p>

Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo\u2019s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\n\n## Act 1: Roger Federer\n\n![Roger Federer](/images/esq-roger-federer-wimbledon-2012-xlg.jpeg)\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change \u2013 most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many \u2013 and he\u2019s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn\u2019t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer\u2019s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn\u2019t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\n\nBut 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\n\nFor me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn\u2019t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I\u2019d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It\u2019s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\n\n## Act 2: J Dilla\n\n![J Dilla](/images/dilla.jpeg)\n\nMy hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn\u2019t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres \u2013 hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica \u2013 and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\n\nBy now, I\u2019d discovered he\u2019d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to Donuts, didn\u2019t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with [every new anecdote and every year that passes](https://sampleface.co.uk/?s=donuts). His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\n\n## Act 3: Union and Victory\n\n![Roger Federer, Wimbledon Champion 2012](/images/Roger-Federer-Wimbledon-Champion-2012_2792722.jpeg)\n\nBut how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla\u2019s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer\u2019s and Murray\u2019s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn\u2019t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn\u2019t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles\u2019 Hard Day\u2019s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\n\nThe Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. \u201CI knew it\u201D, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad\u2019s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\n\n## Reprise\n\n![J Dilla's basement](/images/4dilla.jpeg)\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He\u2019s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It\u2019s likely his champion days are over at that level. I\u2019m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don\u2019t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won\u2019t be leaving the sport completely.\n\nAs for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best \u201Cdisciples\u201D is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla\u2019s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I\u2019ve been rinsing out for years, the \u201Cnewer\u201D stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.\n", "html": '<p>I\u2019m proud of this essay; it\u2019s the only one of its kind. Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo\u2019s attempts.)

Federer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won’t be leaving the sport completely.</p><p>As for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best “disciples” is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla’s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I’ve been rinsing out for years, the “newer” stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.</p>` })}`;

Python. It's a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I've felt both. Sometimes, at the same time. For all its wonderful use cases, quirks, and benefits, it is misunderstood. I'm not here to say it's the greatest programming language (that's HTML) but I wanted to talk about Python from my experience.

tl;dr - I'm going to do this in a list format and some of it will be tongue-in-cheek but the summary is: **Python is something that you don't have to learn if you don't want to in SEO**. I can't stress that enough. This is more of a reassurance than an introduction to Python.

Let's go!

1. Whether you want to be the best SEO (that's an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don't **need** Python in your career. Learning Python is a choice and should be considered with variability.
1a. You get out of it what you put in but you can get more out than you'd expect. Learning Python's basic functions can speed up work you may have been doing manually or formulaically in Google Sheets/Excel to the point your computer crashes because you've exported a 80,000-row CSV of keywords from Ahrefs
2. I started learning Python in October 2019 because I felt extreme FOMO and also inspiration, having seen Ruth Everett do it.
2a. Ruth, if you're reading this, thank you for inadvertently doing that. It has changed my life and career for the better!
3. In the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn't feel like I'd be able to do those things ever.
4. Because of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn't understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches
5. Eventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to [the Python course I'd started](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/).
6. I still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don't but it works so I don't care (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!)
7. My background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don't get on but I tolerate it because I have to. I don't want to talk about it.
8. In the SEO community, there are more articles demonstrating intermediate and advanced concepts than there are basics and this is overwhelming for beginners and even intermediate and advanced users.
8a. Because of this, it puts people off from even starting and fuels the ideology that Python is a fad for nerds who don't care about content and links and then you get people scoffing at it and demanding we focus on content and links and strategy as if those ideas has ever been ignored in the history of SEO
9. If you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.
10. [The script that I wrote about about a week ago](/post/introducing-ralts/) took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it's still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.
10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don't neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don't necessarily _have_ to but if you're planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.
10b. Actually, it's best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.
11. If in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don't work
12. Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!
13. Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything
14. Don't listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it's slow or it won't get you a job. They're not that cute, their hair's uneven, and they look dusty.
14a. Also don't listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you'll "fall behind". There are plenty of "experts" making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn't recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can't be "less". I don't hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.
15. Despite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven't finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don't always remember
16. After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren't relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I'd have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it
16a. Most of what you see probably won't help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you'll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it's unknown to them.
17. Learn it if you think it's cool and interesting and want to see how it works. It's absolutely cool if you do little things for yourself and move on. That's not failure and even if it was, at least you succeeded at trying it.
18. To echo the sentiments of Miracle Inameti-Archibong in her recent Women In Tech SEO talk, play with existing code that's already out there. You don't have to create new ones.
18a. From a learning perspective, it might be easier for you to use an existing script, find a fault or improvement, and do that one specific thing. Congrats&mdash;you just learnt how to code!

You can contact me (links are on the homepage) if you ever want to chat about Python, my experiences, how to get started, what I've used it for, anything. For us to enjoy and grow, we need love, care, and a sense of community. Everyone should be safe with the decisions they make, whether that means learning Python or not. I can't guarantee it won't be overwhelming because I still feel that way sometimes. But there are people around to ask for help (including me) and you're within your rights to take a deep breath, close your laptop and leave it for a day, week, or month until you're ready to come back. Or just leave it there. There are no obligations other than the ones you set yourself. It's good to be disciplined with how you learn as it can build structure to learn and grow but that shouldn't come at the expense of your peace. Python isn't _that_ cool!

Python. It's a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I've felt both. Sometimes, at the same time. For all its wonderful use cases, quirks, and benefits, it is misunderstood. I'm not here to say it's the greatest programming language (that's HTML) but I wanted to talk about Python from my experience.

tl;dr - I'm going to do this in a list format and some of it will be tongue-in-cheek but the summary is: **Python is something that you don't have to learn if you don't want to in SEO**. I can't stress that enough. This is more of a reassurance than an introduction to Python.

Let's go!

1. Whether you want to be the best SEO (that's an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don't **need** Python in your career. Learning Python is a choice and should be considered with variability.
1a. You get out of it what you put in but you can get more out than you'd expect. Learning Python's basic functions can speed up work you may have been doing manually or formulaically in Google Sheets/Excel to the point your computer crashes because you've exported a 80,000-row CSV of keywords from Ahrefs
2. I started learning Python in October 2019 because I felt extreme FOMO and also inspiration, having seen Ruth Everett do it.
2a. Ruth, if you're reading this, thank you for inadvertently doing that. It has changed my life and career for the better!
3. In the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn't feel like I'd be able to do those things ever.
4. Because of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn't understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches
5. Eventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to [the Python course I'd started](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/).
6. I still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don't but it works so I don't care (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!)
7. My background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don't get on but I tolerate it because I have to. I don't want to talk about it.
8. In the SEO community, there are more articles demonstrating intermediate and advanced concepts than there are basics and this is overwhelming for beginners and even intermediate and advanced users.
8a. Because of this, it puts people off from even starting and fuels the ideology that Python is a fad for nerds who don't care about content and links and then you get people scoffing at it and demanding we focus on content and links and strategy as if those ideas has ever been ignored in the history of SEO
9. If you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.
10. [The script that I wrote about about a week ago](/post/introducing-ralts/) took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it's still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.
10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don't neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don't necessarily _have_ to but if you're planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.
10b. Actually, it's best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.
11. If in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don't work
12. Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!
13. Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything
14. Don't listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it's slow or it won't get you a job. They're not that cute, their hair's uneven, and they look dusty.
14a. Also don't listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you'll "fall behind". There are plenty of "experts" making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn't recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can't be "less". I don't hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.
15. Despite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven't finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don't always remember
16. After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren't relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I'd have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it
16a. Most of what you see probably won't help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you'll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it's unknown to them.
17. Learn it if you think it's cool and interesting and want to see how it works. It's absolutely cool if you do little things for yourself and move on. That's not failure and even if it was, at least you succeeded at trying it.
18. To echo the sentiments of Miracle Inameti-Archibong in her recent Women In Tech SEO talk, play with existing code that's already out there. You don't have to create new ones.
18a. From a learning perspective, it might be easier for you to use an existing script, find a fault or improvement, and do that one specific thing. Congrats&mdash;you just learnt how to code!

It’s a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I’ve felt both. Sometimes, at the same time. For all its wonderful use cases, quirks, and benefits, it is misunderstood. I’m not here to say it’s the greatest programming language (that’s HTML) but I wanted to talk about Python from my experience.</p><p>tl;dr - I’m going to do this in a list format and some of it will be tongue-in-cheek but the summary is: <strong>Python is something that you don’t have to learn if you don’t want to in SEO</strong>. I can’t stress that enough. This is more of a reassurance than an introduction to Python.</p><p>Let’s go!</p><ol>
<li>Whether you want to be the best SEO (that’s an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don’t <strong>need</strong> Python in your career. Learning Python is a choice and should be considered with variability.
1a. You get out of it what you put in but you can get more out than you’d expect. Learning Python’s basic functions can speed up work you may have been doing manually or formulaically in Google Sheets/Excel to the point your computer crashes because you’ve exported a 80,000-row CSV of keywords from Ahrefs</li>
<li>I started learning Python in October 2019 because I felt extreme FOMO and also inspiration, having seen Ruth Everett do it.
2a. Ruth, if you’re reading this, thank you for inadvertently doing that. It has changed my life and career for the better!</li>
<li>In the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn’t feel like I’d be able to do those things ever.</li>
<li>Because of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn’t understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we’ve all done it so don’t you <strong>dare</strong> scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches</li>
<li>Eventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/">the Python course I’d started</a>.</li>
<li>I still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don’t but it works so I don’t care (we’ve all done it so don’t you <strong>dare</strong> scoff!)</li>
<li>My background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don’t get on but I tolerate it because I have to. I don’t want to talk about it.</li>
<li>In the SEO community, there are more articles demonstrating intermediate and advanced concepts than there are basics and this is overwhelming for beginners and even intermediate and advanced users.
8a. Because of this, it puts people off from even starting and fuels the ideology that Python is a fad for nerds who don’t care about content and links and then you get people scoffing at it and demanding we focus on content and links and strategy as if those ideas has ever been ignored in the history of SEO</li>
<li>If you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.</li>
<li><a href="/post/introducing-ralts/">The script that I wrote about about a week ago</a> took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it’s still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.
10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don’t neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don’t necessarily <em>have</em> to but if you’re planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.
10b. Actually, it’s best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.</li>
<li>If in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don’t work</li>
<li>Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!</li>
<li>Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything</li>
<li>Don’t listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it’s slow or it won’t get you a job. They’re not that cute, their hair’s uneven, and they look dusty.
14a. Also don’t listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you’ll “fall behind”. There are plenty of “experts” making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn’t recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can’t be “less”. I don’t hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.</li>
<li>Despite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven’t finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don’t always remember</li>
<li>After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren’t relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I’d have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it
16a. Most of what you see probably won’t help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you’ll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it’s unknown to them.</li>

This is gonna be a short one. I used to feel really empowered and inspired when I worked on [my music](https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/) or wrote for [Sampleface](https://sampleface.co.uk/) until one day I was questioned about it.

For a sensitive soul like me who takes rejection badly - especially when it comes from a family member - that really hurt and I've never felt the same since. It's the classic tale of "if you've not got a natural aptitude for it, don't bother because there are better people out there and you'll never reach their heights."

Sampleface isn't nearly as prolific as it was in the first couple of years and my music doesn't reach the same number of listeners as it did back then.

I don't need constant validation but because of that nagging voice in my head, it feels like I'm playing songs into a void.

Taken this from a [viral tweet](https://twitter.com/epicgeezr/status/891781690540118018) and [kottke.org](https://kottke.org/17/08/my-five-favorite-video-games-of-all-time). I'm not much of a gamer either so it wasn't too difficult to make a list of my five favourites.

## Pok\xE9mon Gold/Silver (GBC, 2000)

I didn't think anything could surpass Red/Blue/Yellow and then this came along. I was living in Atlanta when it came out but the buildup was amazing. They had display Gameboy Colors in Target and Walmart and I spent so much time on them. The series introduced some important features that still hold true today: new regions, separation of Special into Special Attack and Special Defence, day and night, breeding, but most importantly, 100 new Pok\xE9mon. It has since been remade for the DS and will be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on 22nd September.

## Championship Manager 01/02 (PC, 2001)

I can't for the life of me get into Football Manager. 01/02 holds my heart. I play with updates from the real world as not to feel too archaic and it's the last great game before the change. It's thin on the ground for realistic features but thanks to some special patches, it's not so bad. Playing it vanilla and you get some legendary players who couldn't imitate their "digital" careers.

## Super Mario World (SNES, 1990)

One of my favourite early childhood memories (see F-Zero and Sonic 2 below). I was lucky enough to play it on a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was the best thing in the world. Riding Yoshi was like nothing I had ever done before.

## F-Zero (SNES, 1990)

Another fond childhood game. I only ever played this at my friend's house as he had a SNES and I wasn't allowed one. It's easily my favourite driving game. Incredible soundtrack, super addictive gameplay and then-state of the art graphics.

## Sonic 2 (Sega Genesis, 1992)

Christmas 1993. My cousins got this for their Sega Genesis. I got to play it and enjoyed every moment. I got to know Sonic before Mario (who I've played more of in my lifetime). It's an instant classic and includes good old Myles Prower.

Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I\u2019d draw the line there. It\u2019s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who\u2019ve forgotten or just didn\u2019t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai\u2019s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.\n\nWhat I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?\n\nSo here\u2019s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.\n\n## 1. Rock Dust Light Star\n\nThe title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn\u2019t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I\u2019m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you\u2019re a new listener, but won\u2019t blow you away.\n\n**Similar song**: Couldn\u2019t really think of one.\n\n**Rating**: 6/10\n\n## 2. White Knuckle Ride\n\nIt\u2019s funk, it\u2019s house, it\u2019s \u201Chigh-octane\u201D, it\u2019s Jamiroquai. If it wasn\u2019t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It\u2019s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: \u201CPressure, it\u2019s not so easy to control\u201D. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.\n\n**Similar song**: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 3. Smoke and Mirrors\n\nSomeone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn\u2019t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It\u2019s a welcome return and it\u2019s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.\n\n**Similar song**: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 4. All Good In The Hood\n\nI remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn\u2019t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn\u2019t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&B (separate rant for a separate day).\n\n**Similar song**:  Soul Education from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 5. Hurtin\u2019\n\nThis track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he\u2019s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it\u2019s their second full foray into a genre they\u2019ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I\u2019ll leave that question up to you, folks.\n\n**Similar song**: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 6. Blue Skies\n\nWhat\u2026 a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can\u2019t be right. Well it is. And it\u2019s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I\u2019ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren\u2019t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard people say \u201Cthey sing the same stuff over and over\u201D to which I\u2019d reply \u201Cyeah, because they\u2019re a funk band. You don\u2019t say that about James Brown, do you?\u201D. I haven\u2019t said that yet, but I will one day. It\u2019s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it\u2019d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it\u2019s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s definitely a radio favourite.\n\n**Similar song**: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 7. Lifeline\n\nThere seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It\u2019s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we\u2019d break up. That never happened). It\u2019s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.\n\n**Similar song**: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 8. She\u2019s a Fast Persuader\n\nThis. Song. Rocks. My. Socks. Into. Space. I\u2019m getting goosebumps just from writing about it. I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I\u2019m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, an instrumental that didn\u2019t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass\u2026 eargasmic. It\u2019s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.\n\n**Similar song**: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey\n\n**Rating**: 10/10\n\n## 9. Two Completely Different Things\n\nJay Kay says it\u2019s from Synkronized, Matt Johnson says it\u2019s from Dynamite. It has elements of both albums but I\u2019d probably side with Matt on this one. It\u2019s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it\u2019d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.\n\n**Similar song**: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 10. Goodbye To My Dancer\n\nAnother title that had me laughing and scratching my head (this time I actually acted on my thoughts, but still didn\u2019t laugh out loud) but I needn\u2019t. For me, it\u2019s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!). It has a African/Latin kind of feel, which could be an overflow from the previous track and it works.\n\n**Similar song**: Can\u2019t think, feel free to help me out here\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 11. Never Gonna Be Another\n\nThis one almost copies the chords from the previous tracks and adds to the melancholy. It\u2019s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it\u2019s a good break up song if you\u2019re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you\u2019re not 14 anymore).\n\n**Similar song**: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 6.5/10\n\n## 12. Hey Floyd\n\nNow this is how you finish an album. Grand, majestic and multi-layered. It\u2019d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who\u2019s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn\u2019t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\n\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn\u2019t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n> \u201CThat Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.\u201D\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he\u2019s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it\u2019s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I\u2019m digressing from the main point.\n\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It\u2019s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it\u2019s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They\u2019re behaving more like an indie band, which I don\u2019t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn\u2019t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It\u2019s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it\u2019s going to be a white knuckle ride.\n\n**Final rating**: 8/10", "html": '<h2 id="here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better">\u201CHere it is, there\u2019s no way to make it better.\u201D</h2>\n<p>One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai\u2019s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star. Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I\u2019d draw the line there. It\u2019s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who\u2019ve forgotten or just didn\u2019t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai\u2019s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.</p>\n<p>What I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id="1-rock-dust-light-star">1.

It\u2019s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: \u201CPressure, it\u2019s not so easy to control\u201D. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<h2 id="3-smoke-and-mirrors">3. Smoke and Mirrors</h2>\n<p>Someone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn\u2019t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It\u2019s a welcome return and it\u2019s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<h2 id="4-all-good-in-the-hood">4. All Good In The Hood</h2>\n<p>I remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn\u2019t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn\u2019t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&#x26;B (separate rant for a separate day).</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>:  Soul Education from Synkronized</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="5-hurtin">5. Hurtin\u2019</h2>\n<p>This track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he\u2019s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it\u2019s their second full foray into a genre they\u2019ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya?

I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I\u2019ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren\u2019t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard people say \u201Cthey sing the same stuff over and over\u201D to which I\u2019d reply \u201Cyeah, because they\u2019re a funk band. You don\u2019t say that about James Brown, do you?\u201D. I haven\u2019t said that yet, but I will one day. It\u2019s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it\u2019d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it\u2019s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn\u2019t.

I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I\u2019m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, an instrumental that didn\u2019t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass\u2026 eargasmic. It\u2019s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year.

When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn\u2019t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\n\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn\u2019t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n> \u201CThat Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.\u201D\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he\u2019s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it\u2019s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I\u2019m digressing from the main point.\n\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It\u2019s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it\u2019s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They\u2019re behaving more like an indie band, which I don\u2019t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn\u2019t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It\u2019s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it\u2019s going to be a white knuckle ride.\n\n**Final rating**: 8/10", "html": '<h2 id="here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better">\u201CHere it is, there\u2019s no way to make it better.\u201D</h2>\n<p>One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai\u2019s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star. Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I\u2019d draw the line there. It\u2019s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who\u2019ve forgotten or just didn\u2019t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai\u2019s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.</p>\n<p>What I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id="1-rock-dust-light-star">1. Rock Dust Light Star</h2>\n<p>The title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn\u2019t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I\u2019m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you\u2019re a new listener, but won\u2019t blow you away.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Couldn\u2019t really think of one.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 6/10</p>\n<h2 id="2-white-knuckle-ride">2. White Knuckle Ride</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s funk, it\u2019s house, it\u2019s \u201Chigh-octane\u201D, it\u2019s Jamiroquai. If it wasn\u2019t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It\u2019s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: \u201CPressure, it\u2019s not so easy to control\u201D. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<h2 id="3-smoke-and-mirrors">3. Smoke and Mirrors</h2>\n<p>Someone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn\u2019t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It\u2019s a welcome return and it\u2019s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<h2 id="4-all-good-in-the-hood">4. All Good In The Hood</h2>\n<p>I remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn\u2019t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn\u2019t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&#x26;B (separate rant for a separate day).</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>:  Soul Education from Synkronized</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="5-hurtin">5. Hurtin\u2019</h2>\n<p>This track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he\u2019s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it\u2019s their second full foray into a genre they\u2019ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I\u2019ll leave that question up to you, folks.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<h2 id="6-blue-skies">6. Blue Skies</h2>\n<p>What\u2026 a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can\u2019t be right. Well it is. And it\u2019s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I\u2019ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren\u2019t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard people say \u201Cthey sing the same stuff over and over\u201D to which I\u2019d reply \u201Cyeah, because they\u2019re a funk band. You don\u2019t say that about James Brown, do you?\u201D. I haven\u2019t said that yet, but I will one day. It\u2019s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it\u2019d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it\u2019s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s definitely a radio favourite.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<h2 id="7-lifeline">7. Lifeline</h2>\n<p>There seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It\u2019s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we\u2019d break up. That never happened). It\u2019s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="8-shes-a-fast-persuader">8.

I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I\u2019m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, an instrumental that didn\u2019t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass\u2026 eargasmic. It\u2019s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 10/10</p>\n<h2 id="9-two-completely-different-things">9.

It has elements of both albums but I\u2019d probably side with Matt on this one. It\u2019s very summery and feel good.

It\u2019s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it\u2019s a good break up song if you\u2019re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you\u2019re not 14 anymore).</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 6.5/10</p>\n<h2 id="12-hey-floyd">12.

Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it\u2019s a good break up song if you\u2019re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you\u2019re not 14 anymore).\n\n**Similar song**: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 6.5/10\n\n## 12.

It\u2019d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who\u2019s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn\u2019t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\n\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn\u2019t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n> \u201CThat Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.\u201D\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he\u2019s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it\u2019s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I\u2019m digressing from the main point.\n\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It\u2019s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it\u2019s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They\u2019re behaving more like an indie band, which I don\u2019t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn\u2019t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It\u2019s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it\u2019s going to be a white knuckle ride.\n\n**Final rating**: 8/10", "html": '<h2 id="here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better">\u201CHere it is, there\u2019s no way to make it better.\u201D</h2>\n<p>One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai\u2019s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star. Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I\u2019d draw the line there. It\u2019s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who\u2019ve forgotten or just didn\u2019t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai\u2019s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.</p>\n<p>What I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id="1-rock-dust-light-star">1. Rock Dust Light Star</h2>\n<p>The title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn\u2019t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I\u2019m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you\u2019re a new listener, but won\u2019t blow you away.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Couldn\u2019t really think of one.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 6/10</p>\n<h2 id="2-white-knuckle-ride">2. White Knuckle Ride</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s funk, it\u2019s house, it\u2019s \u201Chigh-octane\u201D, it\u2019s Jamiroquai. If it wasn\u2019t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It\u2019s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: \u201CPressure, it\u2019s not so easy to control\u201D. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<h2 id="3-smoke-and-mirrors">3. Smoke and Mirrors</h2>\n<p>Someone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn\u2019t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It\u2019s a welcome return and it\u2019s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<h2 id="4-all-good-in-the-hood">4. All Good In The Hood</h2>\n<p>I remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn\u2019t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn\u2019t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&#x26;B (separate rant for a separate day).</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>:  Soul Education from Synkronized</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="5-hurtin">5. Hurtin\u2019</h2>\n<p>This track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he\u2019s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it\u2019s their second full foray into a genre they\u2019ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I\u2019ll leave that question up to you, folks.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<h2 id="6-blue-skies">6. Blue Skies</h2>\n<p>What\u2026 a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can\u2019t be right. Well it is. And it\u2019s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I\u2019ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren\u2019t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard people say \u201Cthey sing the same stuff over and over\u201D to which I\u2019d reply \u201Cyeah, because they\u2019re a funk band. You don\u2019t say that about James Brown, do you?\u201D. I haven\u2019t said that yet, but I will one day. It\u2019s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it\u2019d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it\u2019s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s definitely a radio favourite.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<h2 id="7-lifeline">7. Lifeline</h2>\n<p>There seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It\u2019s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we\u2019d break up. That never happened). It\u2019s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="8-shes-a-fast-persuader">8.

I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I\u2019m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, an instrumental that didn\u2019t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass\u2026 eargasmic. It\u2019s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 10/10</p>\n<h2 id="9-two-completely-different-things">9.

It has elements of both albums but I\u2019d probably side with Matt on this one. It\u2019s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it\u2019d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar song</strong>: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized</p>\n<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<h2 id="10-goodbye-to-my-dancer">10.

For me, it\u2019s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!).

A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It’s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it’s going to be a white knuckle ride.</p><p><strong>Final rating</strong>: 8/10</p>` })}`;

[kottke.org](https://kottke.org/20/03/why-do-poor-people-make-bad-decisions) published an article called "Why Do Poor People Make Bad Decisions?", referencing an article by Rutger Bregman about "why poor people make low-quality decisions".

If that opening gambit wasn't bad enough, I forced myself to read the rest. Apparently the reason poor people make bad decisions is because "living in poverty overwhelms their brains, decreasing cognitive ability by a significant amount". But it got worse. Two studies were quoted, both taking place in India and the USA (the latter looking at Cherokee families).

What is this classist, ableist, and racist crap? And what about the rich people who make notably poor decisions?

Let's look at five of the richest men (in wealth and influence):

* Jeff Bezos
* Mark Zuckerberg
* Jack Dorsey
* Elon Musk
* Bill Gates

They've all made some pretty awful decisions in their time. Especially heinous, you might say. Were they attributed to decreased cognitive ability? No. It was all risk-taking, followed by resilience and admiration for getting back on the horse and trying again. They also had a shitload of money and privilege behind them. Those five men have had the luxury to make bad choices - which have affected people's lives - and get away with them. Look at Elon Musk calling someone a ["pedo guy"](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/unsworth-vs-musk-pedo-guy-defamation-trial-verdict.html), being taken to court for defamation, and _getting off_. Or Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook as a "hot or not" comparison site and then not bothering to fact check political ads? Jack Dorsey allowing fascists to roam free on Twitter while allowing victims face bans for fighting back. Or Jeff Bezos being absolute scum. Etc. Etc.

The final paragraph talks about Bregman's advocacy for a universal basic income (UBI), a 15-hour work-week, and open borders. It comes from his book _Utopia for Realists_ and that's all well and good but then I saw a quote from the NYT calling Bregman "a more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell". Yuck.

Whether you use Twitter for work, personal branding, or escapism, who you follow plays an integral part. But the more followers you get, the more you're likely to follow. The "following:follower" ratio (which I will call F:f from now on) means more than it should to outsiders looking in. If F:f is 1:\u22651 (more than or equal to 1), you're not deemed as popular compared to an F:f ratio of 1:<1 (less than 1).

## Examples

**Following: 1028, Followers: 521; F:f = 1:0.506**

If this is a brand, likely they started by following loads of accounts. Some followed back. Others are bots/accounts who follow back regardless of who you are. Customers might see this and assume the brand isn't popular or otherwise chasing it. This is superficial on face value. Content is more important. There are examples where the ratio can flag untoward behaviour. Check out the links below under **Resources and further reading**.

**Following: 231, Followers: 2106; F:f = 1:8.272**

That's a big ratio towards followers. Without further investigation, this account and brand/person is popular. They might have bought followers or loads of bots decided to feast on the content carcass on offer. But who has time to check that?

There's a temptation to fixate on the mystical F:f ratio. But you also want to keep abreast of your industry through many accounts. If only there was a way to meet halfway...

In fact there is and it uses an age old Twitter feature: **lists**.

The first thing you need to do is make a table of three columns:

- Those you follow who follow back
- Those you follow who don't follow back but whose content holds some merit
- Those you follow only through some kind of "obligation".

You can write this down or create a spreadsheet (mmm, spreadsheets!). There's no official way to export following lists but [this is a decent albeit convoluted alternative](https://ask.metafilter.com/321093/Can-I-export-import-people-I-follow-on-Twitter-to-new-account#4630639).

Now you have some tough decisions to make. Most of us fear unfollowing someone and them returning the favour. You lose a follower and wonder if they'll be offended. But this is YOUR timeline. If you don't want them there, they don't have to be. Of course, you could "relegate" them to their own list but we'll get to that shortly. Once you've compartmentalized everyone, create your lists on Twitter. On a spiritual level, I believe everything we do and experience is based on energy transfer; unfollowing and moving accounts to list follows the same principle. There's still a connection but it's a little different. But rather than keep accounts on a list like dusty pig ornaments in a glass cabinet, use them. Lists are basically organised timelines. If you need some inspiration for a certain topic, tap into the relevant list.

With a more ordered following list, you can receive more necessary content and more accounts are grouped in lists. And it looks good to people who live and die by the F:f ratio.

Whether you use Twitter for work, personal branding, or escapism, who you follow plays an integral part. But the more followers you get, the more you're likely to follow. The "following:follower" ratio (which I will call F:f from now on) means more than it should to outsiders looking in. If F:f is 1:\u22651 (more than or equal to 1), you're not deemed as popular compared to an F:f ratio of 1:<1 (less than 1).

## Examples

**Following: 1028, Followers: 521; F:f = 1:0.506**

If this is a brand, likely they started by following loads of accounts. Some followed back. Others are bots/accounts who follow back regardless of who you are. Customers might see this and assume the brand isn't popular or otherwise chasing it. This is superficial on face value. Content is more important. There are examples where the ratio can flag untoward behaviour. Check out the links below under **Resources and further reading**.

**Following: 231, Followers: 2106; F:f = 1:8.272**

That's a big ratio towards followers. Without further investigation, this account and brand/person is popular. They might have bought followers or loads of bots decided to feast on the content carcass on offer. But who has time to check that?

There's a temptation to fixate on the mystical F:f ratio. But you also want to keep abreast of your industry through many accounts. If only there was a way to meet halfway...

In fact there is and it uses an age old Twitter feature: **lists**.

The first thing you need to do is make a table of three columns:

- Those you follow who follow back
- Those you follow who don't follow back but whose content holds some merit
- Those you follow only through some kind of "obligation".

You can write this down or create a spreadsheet (mmm, spreadsheets!). There's no official way to export following lists but [this is a decent albeit convoluted alternative](https://ask.metafilter.com/321093/Can-I-export-import-people-I-follow-on-Twitter-to-new-account#4630639).

Now you have some tough decisions to make. Most of us fear unfollowing someone and them returning the favour. You lose a follower and wonder if they'll be offended. But this is YOUR timeline. If you don't want them there, they don't have to be. Of course, you could "relegate" them to their own list but we'll get to that shortly. Once you've compartmentalized everyone, create your lists on Twitter. On a spiritual level, I believe everything we do and experience is based on energy transfer; unfollowing and moving accounts to list follows the same principle. There's still a connection but it's a little different. But rather than keep accounts on a list like dusty pig ornaments in a glass cabinet, use them. Lists are basically organised timelines. If you need some inspiration for a certain topic, tap into the relevant list.

With a more ordered following list, you can receive more necessary content and more accounts are grouped in lists. And it looks good to people who live and die by the F:f ratio.

I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn\u2019t an issue; \u201CI\u2019m okay with rock music, I just don\u2019t love it\u201D. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone\u2019s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I\u2019ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What\u2019s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.\n\nThe first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he\u2019d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.\n\nI liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn\u2019t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton. There was no real reprieve here other than totally removing myself from the group and the music. The latter came quicker than the former and left me hoping I\u2019d never hear that music again.\n\nAnd I did a good 4 year run, until this year. Thankfully, no MCR but the rock returned and this time, there was no negative association attached. Why? Because the person that brought it back was my girlfriend. Now, when it comes to music, I can be quite snobbish at times. I tweet about rubbish artists and their lack of talent and regard for decent melodies everyday. But when your girlfriend is involved, you have to really stop and think. And listen. So I had a choice: either continue down the route of disliking anything remotely heavy when it came to rock or accept there was a problem and try and remedy it. The vote was unanimous (well, after a few initial criticisms but she\u2019s so lovely, I couldn\u2019t really continue with them) and I chose to give rock music one last go. I started easy with bands I liked on a basic level: Muse. I already liked Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. I listened to Absolution and quite enjoyed it. As they were one of her favourite bands, that was an easy win. Gave Paramore a go (well one song) and really liked Ignorance. Starting to get better.\n\nThe bigger test was the Foo Fighters. Now, I felt the same way about them as I did with Muse, ie. they\u2019re alright. Always knew Dave Grohl was cool, so that helped. On my way to London today, I listened through their latest album, Wasting Light. Knowing there\u2019d be some hard stuff on it, I was a little apprehensive. The contemplation of memories flooding back of college and the emo phase. I played through it anyway\u2026 and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. In fact, I was hooked after just 20 seconds. Not one bad track on the whole album (which I will review this week). I don\u2019t have anything to really compare it to (yet), but it really blew me away. I was bobbing my head to the parts that I was worried about. For the first time in my entire life, I was loving a rock album. It was all thanks to my girlfriend, who inadvertently gave me the determination to break the stigma I had attached to the second biggest genre in popular music. I was already hating current pop music (another genre I may have to try and immerse myself in for the same reason) and with rock, I was hating on about 70% of all popular music.\n\nBut not anymore. I probably should have done this years ago. I would have had more people to relate to and share feelings with on how awesome the albums were, but it\u2019s better late than never. Rock needn\u2019t be about people moshing or thrashing about on guitars making nothing but discordant noise \u2013 that\u2019s what death and speed metal are for (controversial). I\u2019m pleased to have embraced a genre that I had ignored for many years and I\u2019m looking forward to discovering new bands and albums, not only from rock but its other sub-genres and other genres I\u2019ve been sleeping on.

When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton.

2012/13 was my last season as an "official" Manchester United fan. It had nothing to do with Sir Alex Ferguson retiring, I'd just grown bored of football in general. I'm now back to caring but my attention lies elsewhere and in multiple places. These are the teams that keep me interested.

## Sporting Club de Portugal (NOT Sporting Lisbon)

My new official team. I watched them play Olympiakos in the Champions League in November 2017 while I was on holiday and it was an incredibly chilled atmosphere. There was the expected buzz but no nastiness or hostility. And Sporting won! The club is going through a transition period after a number of their star players handed in their resignations, including #1 Rui Patricio, who left for Wolves on a free transfer. Manager Jorge Jesus, who left for the Al-Hilal job, was replaced by Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 and I have no idea how that's going to go. But we shall see.

## Leicester City

As a joke, I proclaimed myself a Leicester City fan when they were coasting in their Football League Championship winning season in 2013/14. I could barely name two players in the team. I got serious in 14/15 when they were close to relegation and pulled off the great escape and managed to name about 5 players. The season after [was stuff of legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.#2015.E2.80.9316_Premier_League_champions). Leicester City becoming Premier League champions after kissing the bottom of the league only 18 months before is the stuff of legend and just what the championship needed. I can probably name 11 players now.

## OGC Nice

The next few teams hold some form of sentimental value because that's what football is really about, right? I have been to Nice twice on holiday and it is easily one of my favourite cities in the world. They currently lead Ligue 1 and they've managed to turn stagnant water to Italian wine in the form of Mario Balotelli, who has 7 goals in 8 games for the C\xF4te d'Azur side. Fingers crossed they can hold on for the title.

## Hoffenheim

A Championship Manager challenge and subsequent domination of the world lead to my attachment to the German club. It was particularly exciting to watch them beat relegation from the Bundesliga on the last day of the 2012/13 season. They've gone from strength to strength since and recently recorded a 1-1 draw with the champions Bayern Munich.

## Fiorentina

This is a recent following and an excuse to watch Serie A again after a lengthy absence. Like many my age, I miss Football Italia with its goosebump-inducing intro and James Richardson's gradual loss of hair. More importantly, it was an opportunity for the British masses to experience a top flight league on terrestrial television. Live Italian football on Channel 4 on a Sunday afternoon? * Roast chicken and gravy can wait.`, "html": '<p>2012/13 was my last season as an \u201Cofficial\u201D Manchester United fan.

It had nothing to do with Sir Alex Ferguson retiring, I’d just grown bored of football in general. I’m now back to caring but my attention lies elsewhere and in multiple places. These are the teams that keep me interested.</p><h2 id="sporting-club-de-portugal-not-sporting-lisbon">Sporting Club de Portugal (NOT Sporting Lisbon)</h2><p>My new official team. I watched them play Olympiakos in the Champions League in November 2017 while I was on holiday and it was an incredibly chilled atmosphere. There was the expected buzz but no nastiness or hostility. And Sporting won! The club is going through a transition period after a number of their star players handed in their resignations, including #1 Rui Patricio, who left for Wolves on a free transfer. Manager Jorge Jesus, who left for the Al-Hilal job, was replaced by Siniša Mihajlović and I have no idea how that’s going to go. But we shall see.</p><h2 id="leicester-city">Leicester City</h2><p>As a joke, I proclaimed myself a Leicester City fan when they were coasting in their Football League Championship winning season in 2013/14. I could barely name two players in the team. I got serious in 14/15 when they were close to relegation and pulled off the great escape and managed to name about 5 players. The season after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.#2015.E2.80.9316_Premier_League_champions">was stuff of legend</a>. Leicester City becoming Premier League champions after kissing the bottom of the league only 18 months before is the stuff of legend and just what the championship needed. I can probably name 11 players now.</p><h2 id="ogc-nice">OGC Nice</h2><p>The next few teams hold some form of sentimental value because that’s what football is really about, right? I have been to Nice twice on holiday and it is easily one of my favourite cities in the world. They currently lead Ligue 1 and they’ve managed to turn stagnant water to Italian wine in the form of Mario Balotelli, who has 7 goals in 8 games for the Côte d’Azur side. Fingers crossed they can hold on for the title.</p><h2 id="hoffenheim">Hoffenheim</h2><p>A Championship Manager challenge and subsequent domination of the world lead to my attachment to the German club.

Whether it be for his impeccable choice of samples through a multitude of different styles, his uncanny knack of blowing your mind with his musicianship or his humility in a sea of egos and gold chains, he is revered as a legend beyond the realms of hip-hop music, and rightfully so. But perhaps something that he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for, publicly at least, is his drumming techniques, both acoustic and digital. The Detroit producer was mean on the MPC but his live drumming had influences on a number of his peers, particularly Questlove and Kariem Riggins, who have since helped carry his legacy on.\n\nThe story goes that Amp Fiddler, a fellow Detroitian, was the man who gave Dilla his first MPC. It had a minor fault and no manual at hand, but he found a way to get it working and the rest is hip-hop history. From there, he improved his craft and soon surpassed his main idols\u2014Pete Rock and DJ Premier. At Dilla\u2019s wake, Pete Rock remaked that he used to be the king but Dilla had taken the crown soon after. His technique started similarly to his peers of the time. The early \u201990s gave birth to \u201Cjazz rap\u201D and the complementing drum breaks that came with it, thanks to Prince Paul and A Tribe Called Quest. By 1993, Tribe and co. had moved onto free drumming, in the pocket, classic boom bap.\n\nWhen it came time for Dilla to show what he had to offer on a major stage for The Pharcyde, it was 1995 and a year after what is known by fans as the \u201CSecond Golden Age\u201D period of 1993-1994. \u201CRunnin\u2019\u201D heralded the start of an illustrious career. Producing under the name \u201CJay Dee,\u201D his music triggered the attention of Q-Tip and he managed to acquire his services for Tribe\u2019s final two albums. Despite the internal strife Tribe were experiencing, Jay Dee, now performing under the collective name of The Ummah, let his music do the talking. Unlike the drum programming on Labcabincalifornia, the patterns on Beats, Rhymes & Life and The Love Movement were a lot looser, slightly off time at moments. This apparent \u201Csloppiness\u201D was no accident, however. Jay was playing it human. Allowing the kicks and snares to be slightly out of time moved the percussion aware from a machine feel and gave added weight to the swing and soul of the music. The two albums he featured on weren\u2019t met with the same acclaim as the first three Tribe albums but that was more due to the ongoing strife between Tip and Phife as opposed to Jay Dee\u2019s production quality.\n\nQuestlove once told XXL Magazine a story of how Dilla had used a beaten up drum kit on the Donald Byrd cover \u201CThink Twice\u201D for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla had used a vibraphone mallet and a broken drumstick with toilet paper and rubber bands wrapped around it because he didn\u2019t know where to get proper drumsticks late at night. His reasoning for using a mallet was to keep the dynamic less aggressive. Questlove subsequently went out and bought orchestra mallets and tried it out when he had to fly out to Philly. Even before that time, Dilla had been instrumental (pun intended) in the rhythmic and percussive elements of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo (although not officially credited), pushing the human element of the drum programming all the way. Questlove clearly learnt a lot from this approach as his performances on the opener \u201CPlaya Playa,\u201D for example, exhibits the funky swing of the rimshot against the booming bass drum to give a distinct sound that permeated throughout the whole album. As Quest said himself, \u201CThe idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.\u201D Talking to Okayplayer, Quest remarked that \u201CWord Play\u201D on Tribe\u2019s Beats, Rhymes & Life singlehandedly changed his thinking towards drumming, because of the sloppiness of the kick, executed with \u201Cfinesse and defiance.\u201C Looking at where he is right now in terms of success, that was a pretty big influence.\n\nBy the time Dilla\u2019s second \u201Cera\u201D came around, the gritty street feel mixed with the brief beginnings of his electro phase, Karriem Riggins had already known the Detroit producer for five years, having met him through Common in \u201996. In that time, he had provided his drumming expertise on \u201C2 U 4 U\u201D and later produced \u201CThe Clapper\u201D for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla\u2019s influence on Riggins was as profound, maybe more so after the release of his debut album, Alone/Together, which featured the track \u201CJ Dilla The Greatest.\u201D \u201CI learned different ways to get certain feels out of the machine, to basically convey an idea,\u201D he told XXL Mag. \u201CTurning the time shifting off and playing the track live. I think his approach was different every time.\u201D Riggins illustrated the point further in a video with Peanut Butter Wolf and J.Rocc. Using the machine, be it a MPC or one of the newer Maschines, as a tool rather than the music maker allowed for more human flexibility in production.\n\nAsk most producers right now some of their main influences and you\u2019ll hear Dilla\u2019s name mentioned pretty much every time. The reason behind this may differ from musician to musician but the general crux of it comes from his approach to the whole process, from start to finish. There\u2019s also an element of curiosity; what sample did he use on that cut, how did he get the snare to sound like that without it being too brash? Video series like Waajeed\u2019s \u201CBling47 Breaks Dilla Edition\u201D answered some of those burning questions with the purpose to demystify Dilla and his production, according to Waajeed himself. Jazz drummer Damion Reid, talking to NPR Music, expressed his admiration for Dilla\u2019s ability to encompass every element within his compositions, \u201Cevery drum, every nuance, every atmospheric sound was strategically placed. Jay Dee embodied, to me, the culmination of all those things.\u201D Last year, ERIMAJ released his debut album Conflict Of A Man and featured his take on Dilla\u2019s \u201CNothing Like This,\u201D one of his most enigmatic works.

So here it is.\n\n## Tools of the trade\nFor the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I'm prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.\n\nThe things I use are:\n\n* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)\n* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/)\n* [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/)\n* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/)\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)/[Grav](https://getgrav.org/)\n* [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)\n\nIn terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress and Grav, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay \xA33/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I'll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.\n\nIn total, it costs me about \xA3140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.\n\n## The process\nI run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can't update everything as regularly as I'd like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:\n\n1. I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly\n2. If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)\n3. If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)\n4. If I don't want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard\n5. I use a special Python script to decide what to write about\n6. I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site\n7. I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don't write about it, I just put the link on there)\n\n## The Python script\nIf you're not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it's purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!\n\n[Raindrop has its own API](https://help.raindrop.io/collections/) which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my [Collections](https://help.raindrop.io/collections). Here's the code:\n\n~~~\nimport requests\nimport random\n\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE'}\n\nr = requests.get(\n'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens', headers=headers)\n\nresponse = r.json()\n\nraindrop_list = []\n\nfor num in range(0,len(response[\"items\"])):\n	count = response[\"items\"][num][\"count\"]\n	title = response[\"items\"][num][\"title\"]\n	title_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))\n	raindrop_list.append(title_count)\n	raindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]\n\nrand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)\nprint(raindrop[rand])\n~~~\nI'll explain each line.\n\n`requests` gives me access to the API and `random` is for the random pick, which I'll explain in a second.\n\nI set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.\n\n`raindrop_list` is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. `('Food & Drink', 7)`)\n\nI create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range.

<li>If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)</li>
<li>If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)</li>
<li>If I don\u2019t want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard</li>
<li>I use a special Python script to decide what to write about</li>

To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:\n\n1. I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly\n2. If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)\n3. If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)\n4. If I don't want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard\n5. I use a special Python script to decide what to write about\n6. I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site\n7. I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don't write about it, I just put the link on there)\n\n## The Python script\nIf you're not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it's purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!\n\n[Raindrop has its own API](https://help.raindrop.io/collections/) which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my [Collections](https://help.raindrop.io/collections). Here's the code:\n\n~~~\nimport requests\nimport random\n\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE'}\n\nr = requests.get(\n'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens', headers=headers)\n\nresponse = r.json()\n\nraindrop_list = []\n\nfor num in range(0,len(response[\"items\"])):\n	count = response[\"items\"][num][\"count\"]\n	title = response[\"items\"][num][\"title\"]\n	title_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))\n	raindrop_list.append(title_count)\n	raindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]\n\nrand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)\nprint(raindrop[rand])\n~~~\nI'll explain each line.\n\n`requests` gives me access to the API and `random` is for the random pick, which I'll explain in a second.\n\nI set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.\n\n`raindrop_list` is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. `('Food & Drink', 7)`)\n\nI create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called `count` and the title in `title`.\n\n`title_count` creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and `count`.\n\nEach `title_count` gets added to `raindrop_list` and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called `raindrop` which gets rid of all the empty Collections.\n\nFinally, I create a random integer between 0 and `len(raindrop_list)-1` and use that as the random index of `raindrop` which gets printed out.\n\nMake sense? Probably not as that's the first time I've ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don't get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.\n\nAs for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis is a flow that works for me and I'm almost certain it won't work for anyone else. That's because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don't have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!\n\nBut the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you're done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just... stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I'm done.", "html": `<p>A few months ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDavisSEO/status/1233102657826566144?s=20">I \u201Crevealed\u201D my content creation flow</a> (as if it was a secret) and I said I\u2019d write about it in more detail.

![Sony design](/images/412A-rqHLqL._AC_SY400_.jpg)

I've not owned many Sony products but I've always admired their design. Here are some of my favourites.

## MiniDisc

![Memorex minidisc](/images/Memorex-minidisc.jpg)
![Sony MZ-N707 MD Walkman](/images/Sony-MZ-N707-MD-Walkman.jpg)

I've always wanted a MiniDisc Walkman ever since I saw my cousin with one. Obsolete is an understatement for this technology but still cool.

## Sony Xperia phone

![Xperia XZ](/images/NTT_docomo_SO-01J_01.jpg)

I owned the Xperia Z5 but this model isn't far from it in terms of design. Simple and sleek, just how I like it.

## Walkman

![Sony Walkman](/images/original_sony_walkman_tps-l2.jpg)
![Sony Walkman Family](/images/SonyWalkmanFamily.jpg)

I only had the CD Walkman with "shock protection" but the original can't be beaten. It's an iconic design and still works wonders if you can find a working model on eBay. Play your cassettes with ease and stay wired for sound.

## Playstation

![PlayStation 2 controller](/images/PlayStation2-DualShock2.jpg)
![PSone console](/images/PSone-Console-Set-NoLCD.jpg)

I never got to own the PSone but I did have the original PlayStation and the PS2. The official controller is a work of ergonomic art and the PSone is wonderful and compact, in its soft grey shell.

## Sony \u237A

![Sony Alpha](/images/Sony_A77.jpg)

The Sony Alpha, or \u237A, looks incredible. I own a Canon but I wouldn't say no to one of these.

## Sony Cyber-shot

![SONY Cyber-shot](/images/SONY_Cyber-shot_DSC_W530.jpg)

Another example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens. If you saw a digital photo from the 00s, it was probably taken with a Cybershot.

## Xperia Tablet

![Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet](/images/Sony_Xperia_Z4_Tablet_%2817110502756%29.jpg)

This isn't the Zperia tablet I own but the range is great. It's not my #1 tablet range (that accolade belongs to the Google Nexus tablet  family) but it comes in at a close second with Sony's trademark polished look.

## Memory Stick Pro Duo

![Memory Stick Pro Duo](/images/MSst_duo_m2.jpg)

Not quite as obsolete as the MiniDisc but not far off. I don't know why I like this periphery so much but the typography is great. That's about it.

![Sony design](/images/412A-rqHLqL._AC_SY400_.jpg)

I've not owned many Sony products but I've always admired their design. Here are some of my favourites.

## MiniDisc

![Memorex minidisc](/images/Memorex-minidisc.jpg)
![Sony MZ-N707 MD Walkman](/images/Sony-MZ-N707-MD-Walkman.jpg)

I've always wanted a MiniDisc Walkman ever since I saw my cousin with one. Obsolete is an understatement for this technology but still cool.

## Sony Xperia phone

![Xperia XZ](/images/NTT_docomo_SO-01J_01.jpg)

I owned the Xperia Z5 but this model isn't far from it in terms of design. Simple and sleek, just how I like it.

## Walkman

![Sony Walkman](/images/original_sony_walkman_tps-l2.jpg)
![Sony Walkman Family](/images/SonyWalkmanFamily.jpg)

I only had the CD Walkman with "shock protection" but the original can't be beaten. It's an iconic design and still works wonders if you can find a working model on eBay. Play your cassettes with ease and stay wired for sound.

## Playstation

![PlayStation 2 controller](/images/PlayStation2-DualShock2.jpg)
![PSone console](/images/PSone-Console-Set-NoLCD.jpg)

I never got to own the PSone but I did have the original PlayStation and the PS2. The official controller is a work of ergonomic art and the PSone is wonderful and compact, in its soft grey shell.

## Sony \u237A

![Sony Alpha](/images/Sony_A77.jpg)

The Sony Alpha, or \u237A, looks incredible. I own a Canon but I wouldn't say no to one of these.

## Sony Cyber-shot

![SONY Cyber-shot](/images/SONY_Cyber-shot_DSC_W530.jpg)

Another example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens. If you saw a digital photo from the 00s, it was probably taken with a Cybershot.

## Xperia Tablet

![Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet](/images/Sony_Xperia_Z4_Tablet_%2817110502756%29.jpg)

This isn't the Zperia tablet I own but the range is great. It's not my #1 tablet range (that accolade belongs to the Google Nexus tablet  family) but it comes in at a close second with Sony's trademark polished look.

## Memory Stick Pro Duo

![Memory Stick Pro Duo](/images/MSst_duo_m2.jpg)

Not quite as obsolete as the MiniDisc but not far off. I don't know why I like this periphery so much but the typography is great. That's about it.

Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my second year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This hasn't changed from last year.

The women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn't have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.

Get more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.

### 2. Experts still aren't experts

Another reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.

I hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.

### 3. You can't rely on others to make changes in diversity

The death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.

It left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can't rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won't face their internal situations.

And that's partly why I started my [Marketers of Colour](https://marketersofcolour.com) project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That's my sole focus right now.

### 4. John Mueller is even more awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Keywords

### 5. It's still about topics

I've been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I've seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don't copy your competition, you "listen" to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.

## Technical

### 6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise

When I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I'm more of a "jack of all trades" in SEO (and that's not a criticism in this game!)

I hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It's where I want to be.

### 7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.

2020 being 2020, I didn't do much with Python besides using the scripts I'd already written. But I need to get back into it

### 8. I love Ahrefs

I wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it's so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.

### 9. I need to finally use a new API for a project

I still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven't done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the Pok\xE9API. Something with natures. I don't know. Help!

## Content and Links

### 10. I want to get better at link building

I remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the "dark side" aka digital PR and while I'll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.

## Misc

### 11. You shouldn't "live and breathe marketing"

When you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to "live and breathe" what you do isn't it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn't so important that it has to consume your existence.

Don't get me wrong, I've become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn't and shouldn't be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I'm glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There'll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn't be the only thing we face.

### 12. I love writing for the Small Web

A few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They're at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.

Oh, I haven't explained what they are. Briefly:

- Commercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for _conversions_, _landing pages_, _sales funnels_, and _ROI_.
- Small Web = the old days of [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) where you wrote about stuff that wasn't for SEO, posted links with no other content

Unless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won't rank as highly. It's that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing _too_ much on SEO. In some cases, I don't care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I _still_ got traffic.

When people ask me what advice I'd give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say "get a blog". Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.

Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my second year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This hasn't changed from last year.

The women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn't have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.

Get more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.

### 2. Experts still aren't experts

Another reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.

I hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.

### 3. You can't rely on others to make changes in diversity

The death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.

It left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can't rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won't face their internal situations.

And that's partly why I started my [Marketers of Colour](https://marketersofcolour.com) project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That's my sole focus right now.

### 4. John Mueller is even more awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Keywords

### 5. It's still about topics

I've been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I've seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don't copy your competition, you "listen" to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.

## Technical

### 6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise

When I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I'm more of a "jack of all trades" in SEO (and that's not a criticism in this game!)

I hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It's where I want to be.

### 7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.

### 8. I love Ahrefs

## Content and Links

Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my second year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This hasn't changed from last year.

The women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn't have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.

Get more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.

### 2. Experts still aren't experts

Another reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.

I hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.

### 3. You can't rely on others to make changes in diversity

The death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.

It left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can't rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won't face their internal situations.

And that's partly why I started my [Marketers of Colour](https://marketersofcolour.com) project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That's my sole focus right now.

### 4. John Mueller is even more awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Keywords

### 5. It's still about topics

I've been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I've seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don't copy your competition, you "listen" to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.

## Technical

### 6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise

When I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I'm more of a "jack of all trades" in SEO (and that's not a criticism in this game!)

I hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It's where I want to be.

### 7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.

2020 being 2020, I didn't do much with Python besides using the scripts I'd already written. But I need to get back into it

### 8. I love Ahrefs

I wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it's so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.

### 9. I need to finally use a new API for a project

I still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven't done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the Pok\xE9API. Something with natures. I don't know. Help!

## Content and Links

### 10. I want to get better at link building

I remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the "dark side" aka digital PR and while I'll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.

## Misc

### 11. You shouldn't "live and breathe marketing"

When you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to "live and breathe" what you do isn't it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn't so important that it has to consume your existence.

Don't get me wrong, I've become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn't and shouldn't be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I'm glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There'll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn't be the only thing we face.

### 12. I love writing for the Small Web

A few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They're at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.

Oh, I haven't explained what they are. Briefly:

- Commercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for _conversions_, _landing pages_, _sales funnels_, and _ROI_.
- Small Web = the old days of [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) where you wrote about stuff that wasn't for SEO, posted links with no other content

Unless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won't rank as highly. It's that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing _too_ much on SEO. In some cases, I don't care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I _still_ got traffic.

When people ask me what advice I'd give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say "get a blog". Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.

This year, I want to increase my creative output. I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they're worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.

## 1. RKZ

There's an element of bias in this selection but I don't really care. RKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I'm not Grade A broke!)

[Website](https://rkzuk.com) | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rkzuk) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rkzuk) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rkzuk) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/rkzuk)

## 2. Arkotype

I'm simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the "passion project" of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pok\xE9mon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.

## 3. Alex Stewart

I went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart's Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books [Moneyball](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780393324815), [Soccernomics](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780008236649) and [The Numbers Game](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780241963623). I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that's how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.

## 4. Liam Wong

I love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his ['Tokyo Nights' (TO:KY:OO) project](https://www.liamwong.com/book). Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you're looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.

## 5. Jer'Maine

I have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It's no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer'Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of [DatCode](https://datcode.io/), a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.

## 6. Nguyen Le

Roger Federer fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I've been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn't poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.

## 7. KUMA GOLD

I can't speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that's where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I've seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can't wait.

## 8. The Music Snobs

It's been a while since their last episode but nobody does music critique better than The Music Snobs. I feel honoured to be in contact with the team - Arthur, Isaac, Snoop and Jehan - and welcome every opportunity for a conversation about our favourite artists. Their opinions don't always align with mine but I have a great respect for them and their articulation is second to none. Forget all those publications telling you what you should think about music and just listen to these guys and who they recommend for the craft.

This year, I want to increase my creative output. I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they're worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.

## 1. RKZ

There's an element of bias in this selection but I don't really care. RKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I'm not Grade A broke!)

## 2. Arkotype

I'm simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the "passion project" of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pok\xE9mon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.

## 3. Alex Stewart

I went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart's Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books [Moneyball](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780393324815), [Soccernomics](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780008236649) and [The Numbers Game](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780241963623). I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that's how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.

## 4. Liam Wong

I love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his ['Tokyo Nights' (TO:KY:OO) project](https://www.liamwong.com/book). Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you're looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.

## 5. Jer'Maine

I have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It's no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer'Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of [DatCode](https://datcode.io/), a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.

## 6. Nguyen Le

Roger Federer fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I've been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn't poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.

## 7. KUMA GOLD

I can't speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that's where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I've seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can't wait.

I'm a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.

[I wrote about my journey in digital marketing](/post/eight/) when I got my job. Here is what I've learnt in my first year as a professional.

## People
### Women in SEO are the best

When I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren't white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It's the best decision I've ever made.

I've learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I'm grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.

### Experts aren't experts

I followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won't name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.

I've seen a lot of "expert" opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I'm not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn't have a place in search.

### There's still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)

I used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn't see any people like me. It didn't bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.

And now I'm "in", I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word "diversity" now as it's lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that's how capitalism works.

There's still a sexism problem. It's not as bad as it used to be but there's still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.

### brightonSEO

A friend of mine went to [brightonSEO](https://www.brightonseo.com/) one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I'm going again this year, with more experience under my belt.

I loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year's being just as good if not better.

## Keywords
### It's about topics, not individual keywords

I spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.

Suddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines. 

### Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight

I've been [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) for over a decade and most of the time, I don't write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)

## Technical
### Technical SEO is my strong suit

I used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I've honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that's where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.

### Python is amazing

I know HTML isn't a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn't for me. And now I hate C++.

Later on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I've already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about [Python's potential in paid search](https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/).

I've still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.

### JavaScript is overused

This has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I'm not saying it's useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it's just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn't the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).

Does a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I'm not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn't the solution to everything on the Web.

### APIs are amazing

Is there anything APIs can't do? Actually, don't answer that.

An API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself "does this have an API" and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. [Pok\xE9mon](https://pokeapi.co/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They're a great way to practise in your language of choice.

## Content and Links
### Use headings more

My scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.

Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they're not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don't help with ranking).

### The inverted pyramid model is a good idea

[The inverted pyramid model](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html) is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you'll read more. I've heard naysayers claim TL;DR's kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as [featured snippets](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/)), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they're ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.

### There's a lot of the same content out there

Today, I found an article called [Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out](https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/) and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:

> There\u2019s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you\u2019ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, \u201CSEO content\u201D has become a synonym for meandering \u201Cultimate guides\u201D and formulaic \u201C7 ways\u201D listicles.

When analysing the SERPs for intent, we're told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the "best" content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there's more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there's a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.

### Internal linking is important

I never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn't know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you're writing good content that links to more good content, you're going to keep a user on your site. And if it's an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.

### So is a good architecture

Something else I didn't pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. [Crawl depth](https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/) is an issue (I'm working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.

## Google
### Google is not a meritocracy

[I wrote a piece on this](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/)] so I won't repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.

### But John Mueller is awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.

## Misc
### I love the Web even more

I've loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School's library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it's used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.

### I love not doing SEO

Seems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those "best practices". Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because [it's not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/)).

If I want to write about something, I'll write about it. There's no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured "for Google". My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don't rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won't let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!

I'm a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.

[I wrote about my journey in digital marketing](/post/eight/) when I got my job. Here is what I've learnt in my first year as a professional.

## People
### Women in SEO are the best

When I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren't white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It's the best decision I've ever made.

I've learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I'm grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.

### Experts aren't experts

I followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won't name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.

I've seen a lot of "expert" opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I'm not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn't have a place in search.

### There's still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)

I used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn't see any people like me. It didn't bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.

And now I'm "in", I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word "diversity" now as it's lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that's how capitalism works.

There's still a sexism problem. It's not as bad as it used to be but there's still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.

### brightonSEO

A friend of mine went to [brightonSEO](https://www.brightonseo.com/) one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I'm going again this year, with more experience under my belt.

I loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year's being just as good if not better.

## Keywords
### It's about topics, not individual keywords

I spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.

Suddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines. 

### Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight

I've been [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) for over a decade and most of the time, I don't write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)

## Technical
### Technical SEO is my strong suit

I used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I've honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that's where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.

### Python is amazing

I know HTML isn't a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn't for me. And now I hate C++.

Later on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I've already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about [Python's potential in paid search](https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/).

I've still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.

### JavaScript is overused

This has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I'm not saying it's useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it's just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn't the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).

Does a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I'm not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn't the solution to everything on the Web.

### APIs are amazing

Is there anything APIs can't do? Actually, don't answer that.

An API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself "does this have an API" and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. [Pok\xE9mon](https://pokeapi.co/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They're a great way to practise in your language of choice.

## Content and Links
### Use headings more

My scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.

Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they're not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don't help with ranking).

### The inverted pyramid model is a good idea

[The inverted pyramid model](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html) is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you'll read more. I've heard naysayers claim TL;DR's kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as [featured snippets](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/)), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they're ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.

### There's a lot of the same content out there

Today, I found an article called [Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out](https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/) and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:

> There\u2019s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you\u2019ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, \u201CSEO content\u201D has become a synonym for meandering \u201Cultimate guides\u201D and formulaic \u201C7 ways\u201D listicles.

When analysing the SERPs for intent, we're told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the "best" content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there's more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there's a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.

### Internal linking is important

I never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn't know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you're writing good content that links to more good content, you're going to keep a user on your site. And if it's an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.

### So is a good architecture

Something else I didn't pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. [Crawl depth](https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/) is an issue (I'm working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.

## Google
### Google is not a meritocracy

[I wrote a piece on this](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/)] so I won't repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.

### But John Mueller is awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.

## Misc
### I love the Web even more

I've loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School's library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it's used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.

### I love not doing SEO

Seems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those "best practices". Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because [it's not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/)).

If I want to write about something, I'll write about it. There's no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured "for Google". My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don't rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won't let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!

I'm a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.

[I wrote about my journey in digital marketing](/post/eight/) when I got my job. Here is what I've learnt in my first year as a professional.

## People
### Women in SEO are the best

When I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren't white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It's the best decision I've ever made.

I've learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I'm grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.

### Experts aren't experts

I followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won't name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.

I've seen a lot of "expert" opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I'm not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn't have a place in search.

### There's still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)

I used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn't see any people like me. It didn't bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.

And now I'm "in", I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word "diversity" now as it's lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that's how capitalism works.

There's still a sexism problem. It's not as bad as it used to be but there's still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.

### brightonSEO

A friend of mine went to [brightonSEO](https://www.brightonseo.com/) one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I'm going again this year, with more experience under my belt.

I loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year's being just as good if not better.

## Keywords
### It's about topics, not individual keywords

I spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.

Suddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines. 

### Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight

I've been [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) for over a decade and most of the time, I don't write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)

## Technical
### Technical SEO is my strong suit

I used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I've honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that's where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.

### Python is amazing

I know HTML isn't a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn't for me. And now I hate C++.

Later on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I've already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about [Python's potential in paid search](https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/).

I've still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.

### JavaScript is overused

This has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I'm not saying it's useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it's just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn't the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).

Does a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I'm not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn't the solution to everything on the Web.

### APIs are amazing

Is there anything APIs can't do? Actually, don't answer that.

An API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself "does this have an API" and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. [Pok\xE9mon](https://pokeapi.co/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They're a great way to practise in your language of choice.

## Content and Links
### Use headings more

My scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.

Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they're not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don't help with ranking).

### The inverted pyramid model is a good idea

[The inverted pyramid model](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html) is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you'll read more. I've heard naysayers claim TL;DR's kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as [featured snippets](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/)), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they're ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.

### There's a lot of the same content out there

Today, I found an article called [Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out](https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/) and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:

> There\u2019s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you\u2019ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, \u201CSEO content\u201D has become a synonym for meandering \u201Cultimate guides\u201D and formulaic \u201C7 ways\u201D listicles.

When analysing the SERPs for intent, we're told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the "best" content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there's more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there's a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.

### Internal linking is important

I never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn't know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you're writing good content that links to more good content, you're going to keep a user on your site. And if it's an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.

### So is a good architecture

Something else I didn't pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. [Crawl depth](https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/) is an issue (I'm working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.

## Google
### Google is not a meritocracy

[I wrote a piece on this](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/)] so I won't repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.

### But John Mueller is awesome

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.

## Misc
### I love the Web even more

I've loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School's library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it's used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.

### I love not doing SEO

Seems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those "best practices". Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because [it's not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/)).

If I want to write about something, I'll write about it. There's no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured "for Google". My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don't rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won't let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!

Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I\u2019m not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is.

Both are bad.</p>\n<p>Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them.

Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/) and [my second year here](/post/second-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my third year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This still hasn't changed from last year or the year before.

I'm especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.

And a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of [B-DigitalUK](https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk), Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, [Crystal Carter](https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/), Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.

### 2. SEOs really love experts, huh?

Two things. 1) I'm honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I'm not an expert. That's okay to say as it isn't a binary construct of "OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME" on one end and "I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER" on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That's how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).

### 3. Many at the top don't really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do

I'll be writing a follow-up to my piece on [Being Black in Digital Marketing](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/), looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I'm by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can't help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we're back where we were as a community. I'm neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I've had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don't really want diversity in SEO, don't know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!

### 4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Technical

### 5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps

Since my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is [AI](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/), particularly [machine learning](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/ai/). I'm not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with [AGI or artifical general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.

I've also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I'd love that one day. Manifesting!

### 6. Python is still amazing and I'm getting back into it.

I released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct [WatSERP script](https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/) that I will eventually reupload in the future). [Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/post/introducing-ralts/).

### 7. I love Google Search Console

After three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It's all about that granular data!

### 8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!

Since moving away from IBM Watson [for moral reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II), [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There's plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.

## Content and Links

### 9. I'm fine with not being good at link building

Link building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I'll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!

## Misc

### 10. You shouldn't "live and breathe marketing"

There's a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say "don't do this" and "you must do that" in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don't if you don't. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.

### 11. Outside of work, I'm a LESSEO

I will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don't optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn't completely unoptimised but not to the point where I'm focusing on ranking.

I chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate. I'm not Bruce Wayne/Batman to the industry.

### 12. I love the Web, SEO as a discipline, and a select few people but I really don't like the industry.

I tweeted that just over 2 years ago. I've alluded to some of the reasons in this post but there's a lot of nonsense and noise out there that you have to sift through to get to the things that make sense.

Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/) and [my second year here](/post/second-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my third year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This still hasn't changed from last year or the year before.

I'm especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.

And a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of [B-DigitalUK](https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk), Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, [Crystal Carter](https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/), Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.

### 2. SEOs really love experts, huh?

Two things. 1) I'm honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I'm not an expert. That's okay to say as it isn't a binary construct of "OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME" on one end and "I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER" on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That's how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).

### 3. Many at the top don't really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do

I'll be writing a follow-up to my piece on [Being Black in Digital Marketing](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/), looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I'm by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can't help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we're back where we were as a community. I'm neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I've had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don't really want diversity in SEO, don't know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!

### 4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Technical

### 5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps

Since my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is [AI](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/), particularly [machine learning](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/ai/). I'm not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with [AGI or artifical general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.

I've also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I'd love that one day. Manifesting!

### 6. Python is still amazing and I'm getting back into it.

I released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct [WatSERP script](https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/) that I will eventually reupload in the future). [Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/post/introducing-ralts/).

### 7. I love Google Search Console

### 8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!

Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/post/first-year-professional-seo/) and [my second year here](/post/second-year-professional-seo/)).

Here is what I've learnt in my third year as a professional.

## People

### 1. Women in SEO are still the best

This still hasn't changed from last year or the year before.

I'm especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.

And a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of [B-DigitalUK](https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk), Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, [Crystal Carter](https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/), Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.

### 2. SEOs really love experts, huh?

Two things. 1) I'm honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I'm not an expert. That's okay to say as it isn't a binary construct of "OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME" on one end and "I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER" on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That's how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).

### 3. Many at the top don't really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do

I'll be writing a follow-up to my piece on [Being Black in Digital Marketing](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/), looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I'm by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can't help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we're back where we were as a community. I'm neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I've had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don't really want diversity in SEO, don't know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!

### 4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level

John, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.

## Technical

### 5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps

Since my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is [AI](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/), particularly [machine learning](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/ai/). I'm not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with [AGI or artifical general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.

I've also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I'd love that one day. Manifesting!

### 6. Python is still amazing and I'm getting back into it.

I released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct [WatSERP script](https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/) that I will eventually reupload in the future). [Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/post/introducing-ralts/).

### 7. I love Google Search Console

After three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It's all about that granular data!

### 8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!

Since moving away from IBM Watson [for moral reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II), [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There's plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.

## Content and Links

### 9. I'm fine with not being good at link building

Link building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I'll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!

## Misc

### 10. You shouldn't "live and breathe marketing"

There's a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say "don't do this" and "you must do that" in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don't if you don't. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.

### 11. Outside of work, I'm a LESSEO

I will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don't optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn't completely unoptimised but not to the point where I'm focusing on ranking.

I chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate. I'm not Bruce Wayne/Batman to the industry.

### 12. I love the Web, SEO as a discipline, and a select few people but I really don't like the industry.

I tweeted that just over 2 years ago. I've alluded to some of the reasons in this post but there's a lot of nonsense and noise out there that you have to sift through to get to the things that make sense.

I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!</h3><p>Since moving away from IBM Watson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II">for moral reasons</a>, <a href="https://www.textrazor.com/">TextRazor</a> has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected.

Coding has variables for a reason.</p><h3 id="11-outside-of-work-im-a-lesseo">11. Outside of work, I’m a LESSEO</h3><p>I will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work.

My content isn’t completely unoptimised but not to the point where I’m focusing on ranking.</p><p>I chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate.

We've all been there - we've asked a question on social media that would have been better suited on Google. My worst related crime was asking "who Ayn Rand was". I received mini ridicule and it was a fair cop. But sometimes the question is asked and we'd rather not trudge our way through Google and its index of links to get an answer. Sometimes the question(s) we ask are quite broad and a simple reply would be succinct and quench the knowledge thirst. And there are times when we just want a conversation.

My parents are what you might call "technophobes". My mum panics at the thought of having to retune the television and my dad, despite using Microsoft Office more than me, often asks for help. There was one such occurrence a few days ago when he needed assistance with PowerPoint. I've used PowerPoint three times in the past four years so my expertise is somewhat lacking past adding and removing slides. But I always find the answer, or at least try. In this instance, he wanted to do something I had never done before. So what would I do in that situation? Google it. It's something he could have done, sure, but he'd asked the question and I had no problem helping. And then it hit me. Although the prupose of the call was for help, there was a secondary reason as well - just to talk. Coincidentally, this had fallen on World Mental Health Day and when the realisation hit me, I felt a wave of sadness. I haven't called my parents nearly enough since I moved out in 2014 and although I'd seen them briefly a couple of weeks ago, this was the first time we'd spoken on the phone for much longer. We've not always seen eye to eye over the years but we've grown much closer now and he's been a great mediator whenever I've needed help or advice. This was more than a technical support and that's why "just Google it" isn't always appropriate.

When we ask questions, sometimes we're seeking discourse on the subject. This can enrich all involved with knowledge and interest and, simply, someone to talk to and not feel alone. It's important not to snub those who are legitimately looking for this.

Firstly, happy new year to you all!

This post has been on my mind for a while and seeing as it's the start of a new year, I thought it necessary to write it now while I'm in a writing mood. There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I've noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic "I was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?" retort. Well, what _did_ you expect?

Of the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being "misinterpreted" and claiming "if you don't say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid." (That's a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago. It was as follows:

> \u201CWhen I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen [...] She turned out to be witty and bright as well.\u201D

It was later deleted after accusations of sexism. No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn't read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That's not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here's a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don't do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can't retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there's another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there's no chance of an alternative perspective - it's just bad.

And that's precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I've overused that word and it's lost all meaning but it's a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it's very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it's not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who's getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.

But where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I've edited and published it. I think brevity is important for 2017 because online media in particular has suffered with linguistic saturation and an obsession with narrative. I recently wrote an unpublished article called [Football Is Dead](https://lastwordonsports.com/2017/01/13/football-is-dead/) where I rang the death knell on the sport thanks to its replacement: The Narrative. There's a lot of focus on talking and writing over the actual event and it isn't confined to the annals of sport. The news is overflowing with jargon, unnecessary words and ill-thought ideas. I've had to block The Guardian on Twitter because the opinion pieces coming through were terrible. I couldn't believe they got past an editor, both in context and general grammar and construction. My best writing has come from an academic perspective, where both brevity and nuance are crucial tools. I wouldn't have got a First for my dissertation without them. We need those tools for what we read and hear in 2017.

This won't dumb down journalistic output as some may suggest. Active writing can still flourish with care for succinctness and understanding of social differences. In fact, these ideas will bolster the messages needed. A clearly constructed message along with the follow through of action and education are vital in this fight against rising fascism. Trump and his ilk don't know the meaning of brevity and nuance. Publications like Inf0wars and Br3itbart are overflowing with offensive and confused rhetoric and because we're in a culture of more is better and they shout it the loudest, it's taken in by so many. That's not to say the direct opposite is what we need - talking quiet and saying nothing never solved anything. It's about saying and doing the considered amount with respect for the marginalised, particularly when their voice needs to be heard and not censored or quashed.

Firstly, happy new year to you all!

This post has been on my mind for a while and seeing as it's the start of a new year, I thought it necessary to write it now while I'm in a writing mood. There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I've noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic "I was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?" retort. Well, what _did_ you expect?

Of the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being "misinterpreted" and claiming "if you don't say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid." (That's a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago. It was as follows:

> \u201CWhen I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen [...] She turned out to be witty and bright as well.\u201D

It was later deleted after accusations of sexism. No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn't read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That's not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here's a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don't do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can't retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there's another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there's no chance of an alternative perspective - it's just bad.

And that's precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I've overused that word and it's lost all meaning but it's a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it's very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it's not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who's getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.

But where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I've edited and published it.

I went to therapy last year.

It came after a break up that opened old wounds and I needed someone to talk to and guide me out. In one of the sessions, I retold a story that had happened a few days prior. I was amongst friends and acquaintances at a pub when I overheard a conversation about Black Panther. The person leading the conversation claimed it was the worst MCU movie because of its implausibility, particularly Shuri's technical abilities as a 16 year old. I seethed in silence but it was bad enough that I spent most of my hour talking about why it made me so angry and why Black Panther meant so much to me. My (White) therapist was very receptive and agreed with my reasoning, which I didn't expect and welcomed.

The fact I felt so strongly about this movie that I brought it up as the focal point of a counselling session meant it had gone beyond so many other films I'd seen in my life. Not even my favourite movie of all time, Batman Returns, a film I've seen at least three times a year since I was 3, would come close in my soul.

But it hasn't been enough to dispel the spectre of White supremacy. After Chadwick Boseman's death, I felt myself searching in my mind for evidence that I wasn't performing at being sad. "Black Panther did have that effect on me, right? I didn't just immerse myself in it recently?" that's what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. "died" in Infinity War&mdash;actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now). And yet, I still had to confirm that I wasn't pretending.

I put that down to the chokehold of White supremacy, making me second guess my identity as a mixed race Black man. You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I've always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn't belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn't crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we *could* achieve.

And that's why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people. As someone who works on the Internet for a living, I have a professional and moral duty to do something about it. And so I do.

Black Panther wasn't the first time I felt Black but it put my soul in the right place and enriched it.

I went to therapy last year.

It came after a break up that opened old wounds and I needed someone to talk to and guide me out. In one of the sessions, I retold a story that had happened a few days prior. I was amongst friends and acquaintances at a pub when I overheard a conversation about Black Panther. The person leading the conversation claimed it was the worst MCU movie because of its implausibility, particularly Shuri's technical abilities as a 16 year old. I seethed in silence but it was bad enough that I spent most of my hour talking about why it made me so angry and why Black Panther meant so much to me. My (White) therapist was very receptive and agreed with my reasoning, which I didn't expect and welcomed.

The fact I felt so strongly about this movie that I brought it up as the focal point of a counselling session meant it had gone beyond so many other films I'd seen in my life. Not even my favourite movie of all time, Batman Returns, a film I've seen at least three times a year since I was 3, would come close in my soul.

But it hasn't been enough to dispel the spectre of White supremacy. After Chadwick Boseman's death, I felt myself searching in my mind for evidence that I wasn't performing at being sad. "Black Panther did have that effect on me, right? I didn't just immerse myself in it recently?" that's what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. "died" in Infinity War&mdash;actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now). And yet, I still had to confirm that I wasn't pretending.

I put that down to the chokehold of White supremacy, making me second guess my identity as a mixed race Black man. You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I've always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn't belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn't crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we *could* achieve.

And that's why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people. As someone who works on the Internet for a living, I have a professional and moral duty to do something about it. And so I do.

Black Panther wasn't the first time I felt Black but it put my soul in the right place and enriched it.

VAT</strong>. Those costs are made up of domain names (new and renewals) and monthly web hosting fees (which used to be quarterly but recently changed). I was stunned. That’s a lot of money.</p><p>In terms of Patreon income, in 2020 so far, I have made $134.01 of which I donated $63 to Black charities. That brings the net income to $71.01 which is <strong>£54.16</strong>.</p><p>That means I come out with <strong>-£120.50</strong> and 2020 isn’t finished yet. This is why I’ve ramped up the requests for donations and Patreon pledges. I love what I do but it costs me money. Besides Patreon going towards the costs for domains and web hosting, I want it to go towards my time doing it all and I’d hope that the people who are and want to pledge enjoy the content as well.

I was about 5 years late to the game but I finally got into [The Read](http://thisistheread.com) a few months ago and catapulted itself to the top of my All-Time Fave Podcasts list. The dynamic duo of Kid Fury and Crissle give me unadulterated life and joy. But other than their wit and advice, their presentation is an underrated element of the show. Episodes are broken up into sections much like any other podcast.

Taken from Wikipedia:

- **Black Excellence** where Kid Fury picks someone in the [Black community](/wiki/black/) to celebrate. One that has accomplished something that is worthy of high recognition.
- **Hot Tops**, previously Sick Sad World, also selected by Kid Fury (the segment has undergone several other name changes, including Hot Topics, Shade In Full, and the fan favorite, "Bitch, You Guessed It!!")
- **Listener Letters** as curated by Crissle (the segment is changed to Listener Questions when done during a live show)
- **The Read** where Kid Fury and Crissle "read" (African American gay slang for giving one's harsh opinion) a person or topic.

These four sections cover a period of around 2 hours. You don't even notice the time disappearing such is their ability to captivate. But what does this have to do with blogging? Well, the format can translate into your blog posts if you're running out of ideas. The debate over word counts, long vs short form, impacts on SEO and so on will continue forever but what you write needs to fulfill a purpose for the reader. A 1000 word essay doesn't automatically win over a 200 word piece because it has more content. Trying new ways of presentation can open new doors to new readers and potentially gain a fanbase.

Let's look at those four sections:

## Black Excellence \u2192 Celebration of achievements in your sector

Wherever you work, you'll be part of a wider community. It can help both you and the community to share the love and appreciation. From a personal perspective, I have Google Alerts set up with specific keyword terms and share stories relevant to my blogs. I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific "excellence" series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you've mentioned them.

## Hot Tops \u2192 Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector

This is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads **must** know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.

## Listener Letters \u2192 Q&A

This might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an "agony aunt" column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.

## The Read \u2192 Opinion pieces, rants, critiques

Op-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I've had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn't write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is **paramount** here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I've written pieces on cultural appropriation and it's important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don't feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn't be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier. Linking the two together will add more link juice which is a SEO's dream.

Do you have any other format suggestions? Comments aren't working so if you do, email me and I'll add them to this article. And go check out [The Read](http://thisistheread.com)!

From a personal perspective, I have Google Alerts set up with specific keyword terms and share stories relevant to my blogs. I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific "excellence" series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you've mentioned them.

## Hot Tops \u2192 Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector

This is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads **must** know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.

## Listener Letters \u2192 Q&A

This might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an "agony aunt" column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.

## The Read \u2192 Opinion pieces, rants, critiques

Op-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I've had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn't write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is **paramount** here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I've written pieces on cultural appropriation and it's important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don't feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn't be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier. Linking the two together will add more link juice which is a SEO's dream.

Do you have any other format suggestions? Comments aren't working so if you do, email me and I'll add them to this article. And go check out [The Read](http://thisistheread.com)!

<p>I suffer from hayfever and it kills me for 4-5 months of the year. It's got to the stage where my current max dosage of fexofenadine isn't enough. One of the best suggestions is a change in diet. Easier said than done, right? But before I give you the list, here are what histamines are and what they do:</p>

<p>Histamines are neurotransmitters that can cause inflammatory responses when your immune system feels an imminent attack. As you may know, histamine can cause swelling in your blood vessels, allowing for white blood cells to find and attack the source in your body. This can lead to headaches, a flushed feeling, itchiness and miserable. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>If you want to keep the symptoms down, try cutting down or cutting out the following histamine-rich foods:</p>

* Fermented alcoholic beverages: beer, wine (including champagne), cider, mead, and sake
* Fermented foods and sauces: sauerkraut, vinegar, soy sauce, and yogurt
* Cured meats: bacon, salami, pepperoni, luncheon meats, and hot dogs
* Soured foods: sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, soured bread
* Dried fruit: apricots, prunes, dates, figs, raisins
* Most citrus fruits
* Aged cheese including goat cheese
* Nuts: walnuts, cashews, and peanuts
* Vegetables: avocados, eggplant, spinach, and tomatoes
* Smoked fish and certain species of fish: mackerel, tuna, anchovies, and sardines

<p>There are also these foods and drinks that can release histamines:</p>

* bananas
* cow's milk and products containing cow's milk
* strawberries
* wheatgerm

<p>Now, I'm not a doctor and don't profess to be one so consulting your doctor would be the best solution. All diets are different and some foods are more important for your health than others so always check with a professional first. This is merely a list of foods for consideration. There are foods that can help reduce the symptoms due to their lower levels of histamines:</p>

* green herbs
* apples
* cucumbers
* fresh meat and fish
* fresh fruit and veg (not on the lists above)
* grains like rice, yeast free bread, oats
* gluten-free pasta
* milk substitutes \u2013 coconut milk, rice milk, and almond milk
* herbal teas \u2013 except green tea

<p>It's also worth mentioning to avoid ready meals and foods containing preservatives. In a nutshell (but not literally of course), fresh food cooked from scratch is your best bet to avoid histamines. Again, easier said than done in this day and age but it can really help you cope through a tough season. You don't want to stay indoors all summer, right?</p>

I did a Twitter poll for suggestions on what to do tonight and "write something" won out so here I am.

This post will be about two things. The first is my new musical obsession, Khruangbin. I was put onto them by a Black Milk recommendation. Their new album [Con Todo El Mundo](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/album/con-todo-el-mundo-excluding-n-s-america) is one of the best of the year in my opinion and I found a video of a live gig they did for Pitchfork. A week later and I've watched/listened to it 19 times. I am OBSESSED. They're just incredible musicians and pull from inspirations around the world which has inspired me to look for world music myself. Rather than wax lyrical about them, I'll drop the video below for you to see what I mean.

The second thing I wanted to talk about is [Federer](/post/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/). After Nadal's "supernatural" 11th Roland Garros title win on Sunday, attention lies back with the World #2 Roger Federer as he aims to grab his #1 spot back and retain his Wimbledon title. He's in Stuttgart for the Mercedes Cup this week and should he reach the final, he'll be back on top for his 310th week. But I'm worried he won't emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players "fall back" on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I'm probably being premature as I've not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I'm unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he's 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible. Ultimately, he's past the moment he should be dominant so I'm trying to be grateful he's even playing, let alone defending grand slam titles.

So, to conclude. Watch [Khruangbin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4xKvHANqjk) and [Federer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpLSW47MPQ) at their best below.`, "html": '<p>I did a Twitter poll for suggestions on what to do tonight and \u201Cwrite something\u201D won out so here I am.</p>\n<p>This post will be about two things.

I did a Twitter poll for suggestions on what to do tonight and "write something" won out so here I am.

This post will be about two things. The first is my new musical obsession, Khruangbin. I was put onto them by a Black Milk recommendation. Their new album [Con Todo El Mundo](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/album/con-todo-el-mundo-excluding-n-s-america) is one of the best of the year in my opinion and I found a video of a live gig they did for Pitchfork. A week later and I've watched/listened to it 19 times. I am OBSESSED. They're just incredible musicians and pull from inspirations around the world which has inspired me to look for world music myself. Rather than wax lyrical about them, I'll drop the video below for you to see what I mean.

The second thing I wanted to talk about is [Federer](/post/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/). After Nadal's "supernatural" 11th Roland Garros title win on Sunday, attention lies back with the World #2 Roger Federer as he aims to grab his #1 spot back and retain his Wimbledon title. He's in Stuttgart for the Mercedes Cup this week and should he reach the final, he'll be back on top for his 310th week. But I'm worried he won't emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players "fall back" on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I'm probably being premature as I've not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I'm unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he's 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible. Ultimately, he's past the moment he should be dominant so I'm trying to be grateful he's even playing, let alone defending grand slam titles.

So, to conclude.

29th January is special for two reasons.

1. On this day in 2017, Roger Federer won his 18th grand slam title. It meant a lot of me as I was going through a difficult period of my life and Federer is my sporting idol.

2. On this day in 2019, I got a new job that changed my life forever. I was leaving customer service and entering the world of digital marketing. I don't exaggerate when I say my 5 years working on the phones nearly destroyed me and after 8 years of trying to get in and failing (I openly admit to "giving up" a few times), the success was sweeter than ever. I started work as a copywriter two months later and the rest is history.

This date is a date of triumph. The last couple of years have been hell but on those two days in my life, I felt like I'd won the jackpot. I hope I can feel even a small amount of that today.

const metadata$1h = { "headers": [], "source": "\nThe title says \u201CThis is not a blog\u201D and plays on Rene Magritte's [The Treachery of Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images). It is also true.\n\nIt is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn\u2019t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, \u201Creality\u201D TV shows. What you see isn\u2019t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren\u2019t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we\u2019re still told it\u2019s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it\u2019s real but it\u2019s not real at the same time.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the \u201Cdevelopment of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals\u201D. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one\u2019s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.\n\nThe simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn\u2019t real and that it was just a programme. This isn\u2019t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said \u201Ccut\u201D, the \u201Cdead\u201D person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.\n\nThis proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn\u2019t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying \u201Cunreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world\u201D, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.\n\nI have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and \u201Cinteract\u201D. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It\u2019s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I\u2019ve done it in the past, I\u2019m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these \u201Cpersonas\u201D are shed and don\u2019t pass through.\n\nThe whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don\u2019t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called \u201Cleet speak\u201D in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn\u2019t perceived to be warranted (I\u2019ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique \u201Clanguage\u201D to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.\n\nDavid Boyle\u2019s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn\u2019t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don\u2019t have to listen to a word I\u2019ve said. These aren\u2019t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation.

It is also true.\n\nIt is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn\u2019t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, \u201Creality\u201D TV shows. What you see isn\u2019t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren\u2019t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we\u2019re still told it\u2019s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it\u2019s real but it\u2019s not real at the same time.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the \u201Cdevelopment of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals\u201D. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one\u2019s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.\n\nThe simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn\u2019t real and that it was just a programme. This isn\u2019t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said \u201Ccut\u201D, the \u201Cdead\u201D person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.\n\nThis proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn\u2019t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying \u201Cunreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world\u201D, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.\n\nI have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and \u201Cinteract\u201D. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It\u2019s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I\u2019ve done it in the past, I\u2019m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these \u201Cpersonas\u201D are shed and don\u2019t pass through.\n\nThe whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don\u2019t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called \u201Cleet speak\u201D in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn\u2019t perceived to be warranted (I\u2019ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique \u201Clanguage\u201D to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.\n\nDavid Boyle\u2019s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn\u2019t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don\u2019t have to listen to a word I\u2019ve said. These aren\u2019t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation.

I debated writing this or tweeting it but I'd rather it be in my online possession. [I tweeted this yesterday](https://twitter.com/LukeDavisSEO/status/1300351382520815618) and people have reached out since, which I'm grateful for. I'm not in a state that warrants therapy or someone professional to speak to but I know my options if necessary. My tiredness is fundamentally two-fold:

1. Personal stuff I won't go into because it's... personal.
2. Racism against [Black people](/wiki/black/)

Not gonna discuss #1 but I will talk about #2. It's very difficult to be aware of the fact that your identity evokes a rage in other people to the point they want you to be dead. Or severely injured. Or to suffer a lifetime of abuse, financial difficulties, and destitution. But it's not as explicit as that some days. Other times, it's a socially acceptable ignorance that, if you criticise, you receive a barrage of abuse or the flicker of a gaslight that burns brighter with every response. And it takes an ounce of your strength until you have none left. I've been running on empty for months. Time away only lasts so long. Talking only works for so long if at all. Focussing on other things only masks it for so long. When will other people make the effort? Why do I have to listen and give resources for them to learn? Why, when they had an opportunity to really DO something, they decided a black square on Instagram was all they could muster, only to take it down a few weeks later when it fucked up their arbitrary grid system? And when you call them out?

>"At least they did something."

>"I need some time away to collect my thoughts and come up with the right words."

>"Insert single emoji here."

What am I meant to do with that? Buried amongst the tiredness is a burning desire to scream in the ears of the ignorant so they can feel just one ounce of my anger and frustration. If the bare minimum is too much for you, get the hell out of my space. The historical evidence is in front of your face and the work has always been there to do. But no, you need an invite or someone to check your work. I will not comfort you when you apologise when my comfort has been a second class citizen for so long. You will listen to *me* now. And I am tired and hurting. Every day.

I want to be left alone to live and do what I want and need to do and not find out Black people are dying or being denied basic quality of life because of White supremacy. I want White people to face up to their privilege and their place in that White supremacist system and do all they can to break it from within&mdash;that's not for me and those Black superheroes to do by default. I want Black women and Black trans people to have a safe environment to be themselves and fuck shit up in every sense of the word. I want them to be paid double the amount a mediocre White man gets because they deserve it. Call it reparations.

But until that happens, I'll have to find a way to deal with whatever *this* is.

</ol><p>Not gonna discuss #1 but I will talk about #2. It’s very difficult to be aware of the fact that your identity evokes a rage in other people to the point they want you to be dead. Or severely injured. Or to suffer a lifetime of abuse, financial difficulties, and destitution. But it’s not as explicit as that some days. Other times, it’s a socially acceptable ignorance that, if you criticise, you receive a barrage of abuse or the flicker of a gaslight that burns brighter with every response. And it takes an ounce of your strength until you have none left. I’ve been running on empty for months. Time away only lasts so long. Talking only works for so long if at all. Focussing on other things only masks it for so long. When will other people make the effort? Why do I have to listen and give resources for them to learn? Why, when they had an opportunity to really DO something, they decided a black square on Instagram was all they could muster, only to take it down a few weeks later when it fucked up their arbitrary grid system? And when you call them out?</p><blockquote>
<p>“At least they did something.”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>“I need some time away to collect my thoughts and come up with the right words.”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>“Insert single emoji here.”</p>
</blockquote><p>What am I meant to do with that? Buried amongst the tiredness is a burning desire to scream in the ears of the ignorant so they can feel just one ounce of my anger and frustration. If the bare minimum is too much for you, get the hell out of my space. The historical evidence is in front of your face and the work has always been there to do. But no, you need an invite or someone to check your work. I will not comfort you when you apologise when my comfort has been a second class citizen for so long. You will listen to <em>me</em> now. And I am tired and hurting. Every day.</p><p>I want to be left alone to live and do what I want and need to do and not find out Black people are dying or being denied basic quality of life because of White supremacy. I want White people to face up to their privilege and their place in that White supremacist system and do all they can to break it from within—that’s not for me and those Black superheroes to do by default. I want Black women and Black trans people to have a safe environment to be themselves and fuck shit up in every sense of the word. I want them to be paid double the amount a mediocre White man gets because they deserve it. Call it reparations.</p><p>But until that happens, I’ll have to find a way to deal with whatever <em>this</em> is. And when someone asks how I am, I’ll find a new line to give them, delete it, and settle for “tired but alive”.</p>` })}`;

I've been poking fun at SEOs that post contextless Google Search Console graphs on LinkedIn to demonstrate their authority and achievement. Congrats, you have pages that are indexable and they've been crawled and indexed!

And now I'm about to be a hypocrite and do the same. Well, not quite. I have a reason and ironically, it isn't SEO related.

For me, a major contributing factor in becoming an SEO was blogging. I've been doing it for 14 years this year and it has got me to where I am today. But I try to do less SEO in my spare time. I call it **LESSEO**. It means I still care to use an SEO plugin to deal with metadata, sitemaps, and Schema. But I don't write optimised content and certainly don't care about meta title lengths. Why? Because I spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week doing it for clients and any affiliate commission I get from links is so small, I couldn't even afford a chocolate bar off it (the Milky Bars are not on me).

But sometimes I _do_ make an effort. An example is an article I wrote about [10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media](https://cultrface.co.uk/10-hippos-from-cartoons-literature-and-other-media/). I thought it was a good piece and could rank for whichever term I think I was targeting. But it got little-to-no traffic. But I wrote it properly this time! Eventually, I gave up on doing that again as it took too long and I knew writing with SEO in mind would put me off updating the site altogether. I am only one man with a few hours spare in the evening. It's quick musings or nothing. Hence, **LESSEO**.

And then, something strange happened.

The article started picking up traffic over two years later. The term driving the most traffic was "famous hippo characters". That might have been what I was targeting all those months ago. What the hell happened? Why was there suddenly impressions _and_ clicks? I've not looked into any trends but I was surprised. And then I figured I'd change the title to target that term since "10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media" wasn't quite right.

And here's that graph.

![A Google Search Console graph of eventual growth after 2 and a bit years](/images/gsc.jpg)

Impressive numbers they aren't and normally, I'd say nothing to write home about. But I'm pretty chuffed because it showed that even though nobody visited it then, they're visiting it now and that shows two things about blogging and SEO that I've learnt over the years:

1. This stuff takes time

It's almost a clich\xE9 to say "SEO takes time" but people still think if you publish an indexable page, it'll get indexed straight away, rank highly straight away, and get lots of traffic straight away and that's never guaranteed. It can be difficult to explain that to clients without beads of sweat dripping onto your keyboard (depending on how challenging your comms are) but it's true. That's why you have to have faith in your ability. You'll know if the content is good enough. Besides, you can't pin your strategy on one page (sorry, I'm writing that to remind myself, not for anyone else to read).

2. Keep writing anyway

I could have completely given up on writing anything after the hippo blog didn't gain traction. Of course, there were numerous factors as to why it didn't in the first place and I knew that at the time. But if the last 14 years have taught me anything, it's keep on writing. Even after the seeds of doubt were sown in my mind along the way, I kept going (albeit at a reduced rate). It's not about whether anyone read it. It's about the fact that I want to write it and I enjoy doing it. This is all for me. The fact I care less about SEO and still get indexed, still rank, still get visibility, and sometimes get on the first page for a cluster of 10-100 search volume keywords is wild to me, even if I only get a few clicks a month. Those are bonuses. I keep writing anyway.

So there's the context. It won't win me loads of claps and thumbs up on LinkedIn but it's cool to me so I'll give myself a round of applause and a thumbs up in the mirror later.`, "html": '<p>I\u2019ve been poking fun at SEOs that post contextless Google Search Console graphs on LinkedIn to demonstrate their authority and achievement.

Congrats, you have pages that are indexable and they’ve been crawled and indexed!</p><p>And now I’m about to be a hypocrite and do the same. Well, not quite. I have a reason and ironically, it isn’t SEO related.</p><p>For me, a major contributing factor in becoming an SEO was blogging. I’ve been doing it for 14 years this year and it has got me to where I am today. But I try to do less SEO in my spare time. I call it <strong>LESSEO</strong>. It means I still care to use an SEO plugin to deal with metadata, sitemaps, and Schema. But I don’t write optimised content and certainly don’t care about meta title lengths. Why? Because I spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week doing it for clients and any affiliate commission I get from links is so small, I couldn’t even afford a chocolate bar off it (the Milky Bars are not on me).</p><p>But sometimes I <em>do</em> make an effort. An example is an article I wrote about <a href="https://cultrface.co.uk/10-hippos-from-cartoons-literature-and-other-media/">10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media</a>. I thought it was a good piece and could rank for whichever term I think I was targeting. But it got little-to-no traffic. But I wrote it properly this time! Eventually, I gave up on doing that again as it took too long and I knew writing with SEO in mind would put me off updating the site altogether. I am only one man with a few hours spare in the evening. It’s quick musings or nothing. Hence, <strong>LESSEO</strong>.</p><p>And then, something strange happened.</p><p>The article started picking up traffic over two years later. The term driving the most traffic was “famous hippo characters”. That might have been what I was targeting all those months ago. What the hell happened? Why was there suddenly impressions <em>and</em> clicks? I’ve not looked into any trends but I was surprised. And then I figured I’d change the title to target that term since “10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media” wasn’t quite right.</p><p>And here’s that graph.</p><p><img src="/images/gsc.jpg" alt="A Google Search Console graph of eventual growth after 2 and a bit years"></p><p>Impressive numbers they aren’t and normally, I’d say nothing to write home about. But I’m pretty chuffed because it showed that even though nobody visited it then, they’re visiting it now and that shows two things about blogging and SEO that I’ve learnt over the years:</p><ol>
<li>This stuff takes time</li>
</ol><p>It’s almost a cliché to say “SEO takes time” but people still think if you publish an indexable page, it’ll get indexed straight away, rank highly straight away, and get lots of traffic straight away and that’s never guaranteed. It can be difficult to explain that to clients without beads of sweat dripping onto your keyboard (depending on how challenging your comms are) but it’s true. That’s why you have to have faith in your ability. You’ll know if the content is good enough. Besides, you can’t pin your strategy on one page (sorry, I’m writing that to remind myself, not for anyone else to read).</p><ol start="2">
<li>Keep writing anyway</li>
</ol><p>I could have completely given up on writing anything after the hippo blog didn’t gain traction. Of course, there were numerous factors as to why it didn’t in the first place and I knew that at the time. But if the last 14 years have taught me anything, it’s keep on writing. Even after the seeds of doubt were sown in my mind along the way, I kept going (albeit at a reduced rate). It’s not about whether anyone read it. It’s about the fact that I want to write it and I enjoy doing it. This is all for me. The fact I care less about SEO and still get indexed, still rank, still get visibility, and sometimes get on the first page for a cluster of 10-100 search volume keywords is wild to me, even if I only get a few clicks a month. Those are bonuses. I keep writing anyway.</p><p>So there’s the context. It won’t win me loads of claps and thumbs up on LinkedIn but it’s cool to me so I’ll give myself a round of applause and a thumbs up in the mirror later.</p>` })}`;

Today, I had a taxipiphany (an epiphany in a taxi) on my way home from my son's school. I was reading an article called [Better living through self-deception](https://kottke.org/07/05/better-living-through-self-deception) and this paragraph struck me:

> The standard model of the happy, smart, successful human being is someone who knows more, works hard, and has found, or at least is heading toward, their own personal meaning of life.

If I could make a couple of changes, I'd say knowing enough is better than knowing "more" and working smarter rather than harder but the key element was reaching your own personal meaning of life.

People spend their lives searching for THE meaning of life when they could be working towards THEIR meaning of life. No two life experiences are identical and it's up to us to find a purpose, bespoke to us (if we want to. I don't subscribe to the notion that everyone has a calling, that it's our destiny, and we should all do that forever). The point is we have the power to do what we want in that regard. It doesn't matter about aptitudes.

<p>The standard model of the happy, smart, successful human being is someone who knows more, works hard, and has found, or at least is heading toward, their own personal meaning of life.</p>
</blockquote><p>If I could make a couple of changes, I’d say knowing enough is better than knowing “more” and working smarter rather than harder but the key element was reaching your own personal meaning of life.</p><p>People spend their lives searching for THE meaning of life when they could be working towards THEIR meaning of life. No two life experiences are identical and it’s up to us to find a purpose, bespoke to us (if we want to. I don’t subscribe to the notion that everyone has a calling, that it’s our destiny, and we should all do that forever). The point is we have the power to do what we want in that regard. It doesn’t matter about aptitudes. A lot of that is rooted in bigotry and hypercapitalist ideals (see <a href="https://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history">Myers-Briggs personality tests</a> and the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/the-notorious-inaccuracies-and-failings-of-iq-tests">racist history of IQ</a>).</p><p>What is your meaning of life?</p>` })}`;

Over the past week, I've been studying early internet culture (inspired by Halt and Catch Fire) and it's really made me think about how SEO is structured now compared to back then.

In the early days, it was centred on discovery through search but then major corps transformed the Web into a land of online billboards and while [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) formed an anthesis, that slowly died and now we're hear, writing "content" that is only meaningful if it's over 1,000 words.

Nobody ever asks people (now defined simply as "users") their thoughts on search and the Web. Their assumed behaviour is based on whatever Google tells us and it's algorithms change their interactions rather than the other way around. That's my belief anyway. I don't have the data to prove it.

I look at how people have reacted to COVID-19 and their submission to governments who have openly deceived their citizens.

Going through my blog feed, I noticed an article from DIY Photography entitled ["If nobody cared, would you still take pictures?"](https://www.diyphotography.net/nobody-cared-still-take-pictures/). That's a pertinent question and something I've often asked myself from a musical perspective.     

I started seriously making music in 2010 after undertaking a Music Tech course. I released 9 albums between 2011-2013. I was in the zone and enjoyed making the music, promoting it and the feedback I gained. My highlight was ranking [#11 in Potholes In My Blog's Top 50 Instrumental Albums list](http://potholesinmyblog.com/top-25-instrumental-albums-of-2012/4/) which I didn't see coming at all.          

But from late 2013, I hit a slump. I had less time to make music, a long distance relationship to maintain and found myself in a motivational rut. I tried forcing through it and that made it worse. Music production became repulsive to me; my body started rejecting the keys and the pads. In 2014, I released 2 albums. In 2015, just the one. Music was holding less of a place in my life and while I continued listening, even that was reduced.           

Part of the demotivation came from a lack of listeners. There was no sustained support after release apart from a handful of friends which I was eternally grateful for. I wasn't expecting a swathe of interviews and features but the ego within me had hoped for more. I understand now it's not just about sending a link and everyone flocks. I don't think I fully appreciated the support I *was* getting, looking for new followers instead.          

I'm out of that mire now and I'm on 3 albums and a single for this year, with a new full release slated for 2017. The important thing I take away from the experience so far leads me back to the original question: If nobody listened, would I still take music? And the answer is yes. I'll be honest and say part of me makes music for the validation in my talents. Music was never a career path I set myself from the get go. I've had to work to get as good as I am but I need external feedback to know exactly how good that is. But ultimately, I enjoy being in that zone making music; creating something from something else or seemingly nothing at all.           

One test of how well I've done with a record is whether I'd listen to this by someone else and the answer has always been yes. There's a lot of samey music out there, copies of the same aesthetic without pushing any kinds of boundaries. I've become a victim of this ideology and I'm definitely not a trendsetter in any way but I reckon my music is unique enough to stand out if it's heard. And sometimes it isn't. But that's okay because I'm listening and I'll still make music if no one else will.`, "html": '<p>Going through my blog feed, I noticed an article from DIY Photography entitled <a href="https://www.diyphotography.net/nobody-cared-still-take-pictures/">\u201CIf nobody cared, would you still take pictures?\u201D</a>.

Going through my blog feed, I noticed an article from DIY Photography entitled ["If nobody cared, would you still take pictures?"](https://www.diyphotography.net/nobody-cared-still-take-pictures/). That's a pertinent question and something I've often asked myself from a musical perspective.     

I started seriously making music in 2010 after undertaking a Music Tech course. I released 9 albums between 2011-2013. I was in the zone and enjoyed making the music, promoting it and the feedback I gained. My highlight was ranking [#11 in Potholes In My Blog's Top 50 Instrumental Albums list](http://potholesinmyblog.com/top-25-instrumental-albums-of-2012/4/) which I didn't see coming at all.          

But from late 2013, I hit a slump. I had less time to make music, a long distance relationship to maintain and found myself in a motivational rut. I tried forcing through it and that made it worse. Music production became repulsive to me; my body started rejecting the keys and the pads. In 2014, I released 2 albums. In 2015, just the one. Music was holding less of a place in my life and while I continued listening, even that was reduced.           

Part of the demotivation came from a lack of listeners. There was no sustained support after release apart from a handful of friends which I was eternally grateful for. I wasn't expecting a swathe of interviews and features but the ego within me had hoped for more. I understand now it's not just about sending a link and everyone flocks. I don't think I fully appreciated the support I *was* getting, looking for new followers instead.

I've taken a break from my main account on Twitter. I run about 6 others and I'm still active on those but I tweet mostly from @lukealexdavis.

And I'm tired of all of it. I'm very vocal about race on my account because I've been subjected to my own relative experiences.

I wouldn't mind but many with privilege don't even use it to speak up for those who suffer, instead deciding to make their own opinions, steal those of the disenfranchised, or play down their suffering (and then calling them out for discrimination when they get called out).

I often say I'm not some kind of expert and learn how to be better everyday. It's not about political correctness (a terribly misused phrase), it's about genuine equality and letting people live without fear of persecution. Amplify voices rather than talking over them.

Whether it's the [Windrush scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_scandal), Kanye being a right-wing sympathiser, or Bill Cosby and Nas apologists, there are people who have suffered or are suffering and people out there defending them.

I've been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they've changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I've decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn't sure whether to do it as it's very niche to me but I've taken a step out of my comfort zone.

<h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2>

RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it's a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I'll explain those all in more detail later.

There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I'll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.

Examples:

* https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema
* https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow
* https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry
* https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring
* https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs

In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I'm a Pok\xE9mon fan. It's a backronym but it works for me.

<h2 id="why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</h2>

tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.

I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I'm a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).

Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn't think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.

<h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2>

Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I've only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I've done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven't finished. You'll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for "stupid code" and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).

I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his [zero shot demo](https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo). He wrote a great piece on [zero shot learning](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) which you should read if you're interested.

[There's also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action](https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/).

If I've taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I've forgotten to credit or if you'd prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.

<h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2>

So, about that original explanation. Let's look at some definitions:

* Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.

* Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has "an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction".

* Categories - The term "categories" is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising

* Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.

* Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They're basically like tags.

<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>

These are the following Python packages used in the script:

\`\`\`
streamlit>=1.0.0
pandas>=1.2.3
transformers>=4.12.3
requests>=2.25.1
bs4>=0.0.1
plotly>=5.4.0
numpy>=1.18.0
textrazor==1.4.0
tensorflow>=2.7.0
\`\`\`

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for the language model, requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for web scraping, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data viz, [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) for the entities and such, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the language model.

Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I'm using is called [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.

<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>

The code is split into different parts:

### 1. TextRazor API key and client details

\`\`\`
# TextRazor details
textrazor.api_key = API_KEY

client = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=["entities", "topics"])
client.set_classifiers(["textrazor_newscodes"])
\`\`\`

We set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to \`textrazor_newscodes\`. [Find out more on TextRazor's Classification page](https://www.textrazor.com/classification).

### 2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping

\`\`\`
# Load model
@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
def load_model():
	return pipeline("zero-shot-classification", 
	model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9', 
	multi_label=True)

# Classification function
def classify(sequences, candidate_labels):
	output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,
		candidate_labels=candidate_labels)
	return output_results['labels'], output_results['scores']

# Graph plot function
def plot_result(top_topics, scores):
	top_topics = np.array(top_topics)
	scores = np.array(scores)
	scores *= 100
	fig = px.bar(x=scores, 
		y=top_topics,
		orientation='h', 
		labels={'x': 'Confidence', 'y': 'Label'},
		text=scores,
		range_x=(0,115),
		title='Top Predictions',
		color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),
		color_continuous_scale='GnBu')
	fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)
	fig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:0.1f}%',
	textposition='outside')
	st.plotly_chart(fig)

def req(url):
	resp = requests.get(url)
	soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')
	if soup.find("div", id="comments") or soup.find("div", id="secondary"):
		remove_comments = soup.find("div", id="comments")
		remove_comments.extract()
		remove_secondary = soup.find("div", id="secondary")
		remove_secondary.extract()
		ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]
		paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)
		return paragraphs
	else:
		ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]
		paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)
		return paragraphs

# Main function
def main():
	with st.spinner('Classifying...'):
		global txt
		df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(
			by='Relevance Score', ascending=False)
		classify_topic_score = list(
			df_classify_topic['Topic'][:10])
		if input_type == 'Text':
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)
		elif input_type == 'URL':
			txt = req(url)
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)
		elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
			txt = ' '.join(all_txt)
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)

	plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])
\`\`\`

There's a lot here so I'll break it down further.

The first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn't reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.

The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.

The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.

Here's how the model classified this blog post:

![A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score](/images/classification-labels.jpg)

The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars ([thanks to Jess for the help with that](https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604)) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.

The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.

### 3. Dictionaries

\`\`\`
kw_dict = {
	'Keyword': []
}

ent_dict = {
	'Keyword': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

topics_dict = {
	'Topic': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

categories_dict = {
	'Category': [],
	'Relevance Score': []
}

tags = {
	'Tag': [],
	'ID': [],
	'Count': []
}
\`\`\`

Arguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.

### 4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists

\`\`\`
# Blog list
blogs = ['sampleface.co.uk', 'cultrface.co.uk', 'logicface.co.uk', 'playrface.co.uk', 'distantarcade.co.uk']

# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs to go in
existing_tags = []
all_txt = []

# Upper limits for tag page range
upper_limits = {
	'sampleface.co.uk': 4,
	'cultrface.co.uk': 4,
	'logicface.co.uk': 2,
	'playrface.co.uk': 2,
	'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,
	'ld89.org': 1
}
\`\`\`

Here, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.

The tag data comes from WordPress's REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).

Also, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)

### 5. The Streamlit UI stuff

\`\`\`
# Streamlit stuff

st.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')

input_type = st.sidebar.radio('Select your input type', ['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])

update_tags = st.sidebar.button('\u21BB Refresh tags')

tag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')


# Determines input types
st.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')
st.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')
if input_type == 'Text':
	txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')
	txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('"', '').replace('\u201C','').replace('\u201D', '').replace('\u2018','').replace('\u2019', '').replace("'s", '').replace(",", '')
	st.write(len(txt))
elif input_type == 'URL':
	url = st.text_input('Enter URL')
elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')
\`\`\`

This displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.

### 6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress's REST API

\`\`\`
def update_all_tags():

	with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):

		for blog in blogs:
		
			# Get tag data
			for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):

				tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'
				r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)
				api_tags = r_tag.json()

				for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):
					tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])
					tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])
					tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])

				with open(f"{blog}.json", "w") as outfile:
					json.dump(tags, outfile)
			tags['Tag'] = []
			tags['ID'] = []
			tags['Count'] = []

list_of_blogs = st.radio("Select the corresponding blog", blogs)

# Load JSON files
with open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:
	blog_json = json.load(f)
	x = blog_json['Tag']
	for n in x:
		existing_tags.append(n)

submit = st.button('Submit')

if update_tags:
	update_all_tags()
\`\`\`

There are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won't change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.

From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.

			da = json.load(da_json_file)
		da_words_count_lists = da['Count']
		try:
			x = [n/(n+1) for n in da_words_count_lists]

def all_blogs():

	sampleface()
	cultrface()
	logicface()
	playrface()
	distantarcade()
\`\`\`

I'll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs' tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags' counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.

Finally, they're all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.

### 8. The entity, topic, and category functions using the TextRazor API

\`\`\`
# Keyword extraction function to analyse with TextRazor

def textrazor_extraction(input_type):

	if input_type == 'Text':
		global txt
		response = client.analyze(txt)
		for entity in response.entities():
			if entity.relevance_score > 0:
				ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
				ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)
				if entity.id.lower() in existing_tags or entity.id.capitalize() in existing_tags:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
				else:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for topic in response.topics():
			if topic.score > 0.6:
				topics_dict['Topic'].append(topic.label)
				topics_dict['Relevance Score'].append(topic.score)
				if topic.label.lower() in existing_tags or topic.label.capitalize() in existing_tags:

				else:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for category in response.categories():
			categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
			categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)

	elif input_type == 'URL':
		txt = req(url)
		response = client.analyze(txt)
		for entity in response.entities():
			if entity.relevance_score > 0:
				ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
				ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)

				else:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for category in response.categories():
			categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
			categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)

	elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':

		for u in urls:
			txt = req(u)
			all_txt.append(txt)
			response = client.analyze(txt)
			for entity in response.entities():
				if entity.relevance_score > 0:
					ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
					ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)
					if entity.id.lower() in existing_tags or entity.id.capitalize() in existing_tags:
						ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
					else:
						ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
			
			for topic in response.topics():
				if topic.score > 0.6:
					topics_dict['Topic'].append(topic.label)
					topics_dict['Relevance Score'].append(topic.score)
					if topic.label.lower() in existing_tags or topic.label.capitalize() in existing_tags:
						topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
					else:
						topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
			
			for category in response.categories():
				categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
				categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)
\`\`\`

Depending on the input (text, URL, or multiple URLs), this function analyses the text, finds the topics, entities, and categories and adds them to a dictionary. I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it'll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It's worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!

### 9. The function for displaying that data in DataFrame form

\`\`\`
# DataFrames to present above data
def data_viz():

	if input_type == 'Text':

		# df_kw = pd.DataFrame(kw_dict)
		# # grouped_df_kw = df_kw.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		# # grouped_df_kw = grouped_df_kw.reset_index()
		# st.header('Keywords')
		# st.dataframe(df_kw)

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'URL':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby('Category').describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)
\`\`\`

The penultimate function converts those dictionaries into dataframes. The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I've used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.

Below is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Keyword     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| Website      					| 0.6620       	  | 0			 |
| Search engine optimization    | 0.6460          | 0			 |
| Web scraping					| 0.6450		  | 0			 |
| World Wide Website			| 0.6440		  | 0			 |
| HTML							| 0.6320		  | 0			 |

A table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Topic     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| API      						| 1.0000       	  | 0			 |
| Blog    						| 1.0000          | 0			 |
| Computer science				| 1.0000		  | 1			 |
| Computing						| 1.0000		  | 0			 |
| Google Search					| 1.0000		  | 0			 |

And a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Category     																	| Relevance Score |
| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	| --------------- |
| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology      		| 0.8100		  | 
| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology>software  	| 0.7330		  |
| arts, culture and entertainment>internet										| 0.6020		  |
| arts, culture and entertainment>language										| 0.5620		  |
| science and technology>engineering											| 0.5360		  |

### 10. Execution of the all the functions to make it work

\`\`\`
# Execute functions
if tag_ideas:
	all_blogs()
elif submit and input_type and input_type == 'Text':
	textrazor_extraction('Text')
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'URL':
	textrazor_extraction('URL')
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	urls = [line for line in multi_url.split("\\n")]
	textrazor_extraction('Multiple URLs')
	data_viz()
\`\`\`

Finally, we have all the functions ready to call, depending on whether I'm analysing raw text or URLs.

<h2 id="who_could_this_benefit">Who could this benefit?</h2>

As I said earlier, I've made this mainly for myself and as a way to improve my taxonomies. I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow ([also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago](/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/)).

But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:

* To analyse text for entity relevance
* To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)
* Content ideas
* To check if your text is aligned how you want it

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

This Python script is not perfect. It's rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.

One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn't fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.

There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I've been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don't like to say "hey, I made this thing" because who cares (that's what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.`, "html": '<p>I\u2019ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they\u2019ve changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I\u2019ve decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to do it as it\u2019s very niche to me but I\u2019ve taken a step out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/lukedavisseo/ralts">GitHub link to RALTS repository</a></p>\n<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="#ralts">What is RALTS?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</a></li>\n<li><a href="#some_definitions">Some definitions</a></li>\n<li><a href="#tech_requirements">Tech requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href="#the_code">The code</a></li>\n<li><a href="#who_could_this_benefit">Who could this benefit?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#evaluation">Evaluation</a></li>\n<li><a href="#summary">Summary</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2>\n<p>RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it\u2019s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API.

I\u2019ll explain those all in more detail later.</p>\n<p>There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I\u2019ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema">https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow">https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry">https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring">https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs">https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I\u2019m a Pok\xE9mon fan.

I\u2019m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process.

By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.</p>\n<h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2>\n<p>Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I\u2019ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I\u2019ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven\u2019t finished. You\u2019ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback.

Let\u2019s look at some definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \u201Can automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\u201D.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Categories - The term \u201Ccategories\u201D is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They\u2019re basically like tags.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>\n<p>These are the following Python packages used in the script:</p>\n<pre is:raw class="astro-code" style="background-color: #0d1117; overflow-x: auto;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">streamlit&gt;=1.0.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">pandas&gt;=1.2.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">transformers&gt;=4.12.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">requests&gt;=2.25.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">bs4&gt;=0.0.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">plotly&gt;=5.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">numpy&gt;=1.18.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">textrazor==1.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">tensorflow&gt;=2.7.0</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> for the UI, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for data manipulation, <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines">Transformers</a> for the language model, requests and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> for web scraping, <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> for data viz, <a href="https://www.textrazor.com/">TextRazor</a> for the entities and such, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> for the language model.</p>\n<p>Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I\u2019m using is called <a href="https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9">DistilBart-MNLI</a> and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.</p>\n<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>\n<p>The code is split into different parts:</p>\n<h3 id="1-textrazor-api-key-and-client-details">1.

I have also set a cache so it doesn\u2019t reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.</p>\n<p>The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.</p>\n<p>The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the model classified this blog post:</p>\n<p><img src="/images/classification-labels.jpg" alt="A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score"></p>\n<p>The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604">thanks to Jess for the help with that</a>) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.</p>\n<h3 id="3-dictionaries">3.

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won\u2019t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out.

I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it\u2019ll give me a 1 or 0 if not.

I've been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they've changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I've decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn't sure whether to do it as it's very niche to me but I've taken a step out of my comfort zone.

<h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2>

RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it's a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I'll explain those all in more detail later.

There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I'll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.

Examples:

* https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema
* https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow
* https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry
* https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring
* https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs

In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I'm a Pok\xE9mon fan. It's a backronym but it works for me.

<h2 id="why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</h2>

tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.

I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I'm a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).

Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn't think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.

<h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2>

Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I've only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I've done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven't finished. You'll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for "stupid code" and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).

I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his [zero shot demo](https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo). He wrote a great piece on [zero shot learning](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) which you should read if you're interested.

[There's also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action](https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/).

If I've taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I've forgotten to credit or if you'd prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.

<h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2>

So, about that original explanation. Let's look at some definitions:

* Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.

* Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has "an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction".

* Categories - The term "categories" is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising

* Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.

* Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They're basically like tags.

<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>

These are the following Python packages used in the script:

\`\`\`
streamlit>=1.0.0
pandas>=1.2.3
transformers>=4.12.3
requests>=2.25.1
bs4>=0.0.1
plotly>=5.4.0
numpy>=1.18.0
textrazor==1.4.0
tensorflow>=2.7.0
\`\`\`

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for the language model, requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for web scraping, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data viz, [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) for the entities and such, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the language model.

Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I'm using is called [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.

<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>

The code is split into different parts:

### 1. TextRazor API key and client details

\`\`\`
# TextRazor details
textrazor.api_key = API_KEY

client = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=["entities", "topics"])
client.set_classifiers(["textrazor_newscodes"])
\`\`\`

We set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to \`textrazor_newscodes\`. [Find out more on TextRazor's Classification page](https://www.textrazor.com/classification).

			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)
		elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
			txt = ' '.join(all_txt)
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)

	plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])
\`\`\`

There's a lot here so I'll break it down further.

The first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn't reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.

The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.

The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.

Here's how the model classified this blog post:

![A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score](/images/classification-labels.jpg)

The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars ([thanks to Jess for the help with that](https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604)) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.

The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.

### 3. Dictionaries

\`\`\`
kw_dict = {
	'Keyword': []
}

ent_dict = {
	'Keyword': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

topics_dict = {
	'Topic': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

categories_dict = {
	'Category': [],
	'Relevance Score': []
}

tags = {
	'Tag': [],
	'ID': [],
	'Count': []
}
\`\`\`

Arguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.

### 4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists

\`\`\`
# Blog list
blogs = ['sampleface.co.uk', 'cultrface.co.uk', 'logicface.co.uk', 'playrface.co.uk', 'distantarcade.co.uk']

# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs to go in
existing_tags = []
all_txt = []

# Upper limits for tag page range
upper_limits = {
	'sampleface.co.uk': 4,
	'cultrface.co.uk': 4,
	'logicface.co.uk': 2,
	'playrface.co.uk': 2,
	'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,
	'ld89.org': 1
}
\`\`\`

Here, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.

The tag data comes from WordPress's REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).

Also, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)

### 5. The Streamlit UI stuff

\`\`\`
# Streamlit stuff

st.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')

input_type = st.sidebar.radio('Select your input type', ['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])

update_tags = st.sidebar.button('\u21BB Refresh tags')

tag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')


# Determines input types
st.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')
st.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')
if input_type == 'Text':
	txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')
	txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('"', '').replace('\u201C','').replace('\u201D', '').replace('\u2018','').replace('\u2019', '').replace("'s", '').replace(",", '')
	st.write(len(txt))
elif input_type == 'URL':
	url = st.text_input('Enter URL')
elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')
\`\`\`

This displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.

### 6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress's REST API

\`\`\`
def update_all_tags():

	with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):

		for blog in blogs:
		
			# Get tag data
			for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):

				tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'
				r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)
				api_tags = r_tag.json()

				for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):
					tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])
					tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])
					tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])

				with open(f"{blog}.json", "w") as outfile:
					json.dump(tags, outfile)
			tags['Tag'] = []
			tags['ID'] = []
			tags['Count'] = []

list_of_blogs = st.radio("Select the corresponding blog", blogs)

# Load JSON files
with open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:
	blog_json = json.load(f)
	x = blog_json['Tag']
	for n in x:
		existing_tags.append(n)

submit = st.button('Submit')

if update_tags:
	update_all_tags()
\`\`\`

There are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won't change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.

From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.

### 7. The random functions for content ideas

\`\`\`
# Tag ideas functions

def sf_words():

	with open("sampleface.co.uk.json") as sf_json_file:

def all_blogs():

	sampleface()
	cultrface()

	playrface()
	distantarcade()
\`\`\`

I'll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs' tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags' counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.

Finally, they're all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.

### 8. The entity, topic, and category functions using the TextRazor API

\`\`\`
# Keyword extraction function to analyse with TextRazor

def textrazor_extraction(input_type):

	if input_type == 'Text':
		global txt
		response = client.analyze(txt)
		for entity in response.entities():
			if entity.relevance_score > 0:
				ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
				ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)
				if entity.id.lower() in existing_tags or entity.id.capitalize() in existing_tags:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
				else:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for topic in response.topics():
			if topic.score > 0.6:
				topics_dict['Topic'].append(topic.label)
				topics_dict['Relevance Score'].append(topic.score)
				if topic.label.lower() in existing_tags or topic.label.capitalize() in existing_tags:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
				else:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for category in response.categories():
			categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
			categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)

	elif input_type == 'URL':
		txt = req(url)
		response = client.analyze(txt)
		for entity in response.entities():
			if entity.relevance_score > 0:
				ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
				ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)
				if entity.id.lower() in existing_tags or entity.id.capitalize() in existing_tags:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
				else:
					ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for topic in response.topics():
			if topic.score > 0.6:
				topics_dict['Topic'].append(topic.label)
				topics_dict['Relevance Score'].append(topic.score)
				if topic.label.lower() in existing_tags or topic.label.capitalize() in existing_tags:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
				else:
					topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
		
		for category in response.categories():
			categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
			categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)

	elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':

		for u in urls:
			txt = req(u)
			all_txt.append(txt)
			response = client.analyze(txt)
			for entity in response.entities():
				if entity.relevance_score > 0:
					ent_dict['Keyword'].append(entity.id)
					ent_dict['Relevance Score'].append(entity.relevance_score)
					if entity.id.lower() in existing_tags or entity.id.capitalize() in existing_tags:
						ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
					else:
						ent_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
			
			for topic in response.topics():
				if topic.score > 0.6:
					topics_dict['Topic'].append(topic.label)
					topics_dict['Relevance Score'].append(topic.score)
					if topic.label.lower() in existing_tags or topic.label.capitalize() in existing_tags:
						topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(1)
					else:
						topics_dict['Existing Tag'].append(0)
			
			for category in response.categories():
				categories_dict['Category'].append(category.label)
				categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)
\`\`\`

Depending on the input (text, URL, or multiple URLs), this function analyses the text, finds the topics, entities, and categories and adds them to a dictionary. I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it'll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It's worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!

### 9. The function for displaying that data in DataFrame form

\`\`\`
# DataFrames to present above data
def data_viz():

	if input_type == 'Text':

		# df_kw = pd.DataFrame(kw_dict)
		# # grouped_df_kw = df_kw.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		# # grouped_df_kw = grouped_df_kw.reset_index()
		# st.header('Keywords')
		# st.dataframe(df_kw)

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'URL':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby('Category').describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)
\`\`\`

The penultimate function converts those dictionaries into dataframes. The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I've used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.

Below is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Keyword     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| Website      					| 0.6620       	  | 0			 |
| Search engine optimization    | 0.6460          | 0			 |
| Web scraping					| 0.6450		  | 0			 |
| World Wide Website			| 0.6440		  | 0			 |
| HTML							| 0.6320		  | 0			 |

A table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Topic     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| API      						| 1.0000       	  | 0			 |
| Blog    						| 1.0000          | 0			 |
| Computer science				| 1.0000		  | 1			 |
| Computing						| 1.0000		  | 0			 |
| Google Search					| 1.0000		  | 0			 |

And a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Category     																	| Relevance Score |
| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	| --------------- |
| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology      		| 0.8100		  | 
| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology>software  	| 0.7330		  |
| arts, culture and entertainment>internet										| 0.6020		  |
| arts, culture and entertainment>language										| 0.5620		  |
| science and technology>engineering											| 0.5360		  |

### 10. Execution of the all the functions to make it work

\`\`\`
# Execute functions
if tag_ideas:
	all_blogs()
elif submit and input_type and input_type == 'Text':
	textrazor_extraction('Text')
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'URL':
	textrazor_extraction('URL')

	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	urls = [line for line in multi_url.split("\\n")]
	textrazor_extraction('Multiple URLs')
	data_viz()
\`\`\`

Finally, we have all the functions ready to call, depending on whether I'm analysing raw text or URLs.

<h2 id="who_could_this_benefit">Who could this benefit?</h2>

As I said earlier, I've made this mainly for myself and as a way to improve my taxonomies. I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow ([also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago](/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/)).

But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:

* To analyse text for entity relevance
* To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)
* Content ideas
* To check if your text is aligned how you want it

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

This Python script is not perfect. It's rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.

One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn't fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.

There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I've been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don't like to say "hey, I made this thing" because who cares (that's what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.`, "html": '<p>I\u2019ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they\u2019ve changed my life for the better.

Let\u2019s look at some definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \u201Can automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\u201D.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Categories - The term \u201Ccategories\u201D is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They\u2019re basically like tags.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>\n<p>These are the following Python packages used in the script:</p>\n<pre is:raw class="astro-code" style="background-color: #0d1117; overflow-x: auto;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">streamlit&gt;=1.0.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">pandas&gt;=1.2.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">transformers&gt;=4.12.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">requests&gt;=2.25.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">bs4&gt;=0.0.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">plotly&gt;=5.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">numpy&gt;=1.18.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">textrazor==1.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">tensorflow&gt;=2.7.0</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> for the UI, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for data manipulation, <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines">Transformers</a> for the language model, requests and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> for web scraping, <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> for data viz, <a href="https://www.textrazor.com/">TextRazor</a> for the entities and such, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> for the language model.</p>\n<p>Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I\u2019m using is called <a href="https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9">DistilBart-MNLI</a> and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.</p>\n<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>\n<p>The code is split into different parts:</p>\n<h3 id="1-textrazor-api-key-and-client-details">1.

I have also set a cache so it doesn\u2019t reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.</p>\n<p>The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.</p>\n<p>The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the model classified this blog post:</p>\n<p><img src="/images/classification-labels.jpg" alt="A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score"></p>\n<p>The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604">thanks to Jess for the help with that</a>) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.</p>\n<h3 id="3-dictionaries">3.

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won\u2019t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.</p>\n<p>From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.</p>\n<h3 id="7-the-random-functions-for-content-ideas">7.

I've been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they've changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I've decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn't sure whether to do it as it's very niche to me but I've taken a step out of my comfort zone.

<h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2>

RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it's a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I'll explain those all in more detail later.

There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I'll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.

Examples:

* https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema
* https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow
* https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry
* https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring
* https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs

In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I'm a Pok\xE9mon fan. It's a backronym but it works for me.

<h2 id="why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</h2>

tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.

I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I'm a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).

Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn't think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.

<h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2>

Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I've only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I've done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven't finished. You'll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for "stupid code" and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).

I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his [zero shot demo](https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo). He wrote a great piece on [zero shot learning](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) which you should read if you're interested.

[There's also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action](https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/).

If I've taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I've forgotten to credit or if you'd prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.

<h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2>

So, about that original explanation. Let's look at some definitions:

* Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.

* Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has "an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction".

* Categories - The term "categories" is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising

* Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.

* Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They're basically like tags.

<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>

These are the following Python packages used in the script:

\`\`\`
streamlit>=1.0.0
pandas>=1.2.3
transformers>=4.12.3
requests>=2.25.1
bs4>=0.0.1
plotly>=5.4.0
numpy>=1.18.0
textrazor==1.4.0
tensorflow>=2.7.0
\`\`\`

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for the language model, requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for web scraping, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data viz, [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) for the entities and such, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the language model.

Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I'm using is called [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.

<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>

The code is split into different parts:

### 1. TextRazor API key and client details

\`\`\`
# TextRazor details
textrazor.api_key = API_KEY

client = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=["entities", "topics"])
client.set_classifiers(["textrazor_newscodes"])
\`\`\`

We set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to \`textrazor_newscodes\`. [Find out more on TextRazor's Classification page](https://www.textrazor.com/classification).

### 2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping

\`\`\`
# Load model
@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
def load_model():
	return pipeline("zero-shot-classification", 
	model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9', 
	multi_label=True)

# Classification function
def classify(sequences, candidate_labels):
	output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,
		candidate_labels=candidate_labels)
	return output_results['labels'], output_results['scores']

# Graph plot function
def plot_result(top_topics, scores):
	top_topics = np.array(top_topics)
	scores = np.array(scores)
	scores *= 100
	fig = px.bar(x=scores, 
		y=top_topics,
		orientation='h', 
		labels={'x': 'Confidence', 'y': 'Label'},
		text=scores,
		range_x=(0,115),
		title='Top Predictions',
		color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),
		color_continuous_scale='GnBu')
	fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)
	fig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:0.1f}%',
	textposition='outside')
	st.plotly_chart(fig)

def req(url):
	resp = requests.get(url)
	soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')
	if soup.find("div", id="comments") or soup.find("div", id="secondary"):
		remove_comments = soup.find("div", id="comments")
		remove_comments.extract()
		remove_secondary = soup.find("div", id="secondary")
		remove_secondary.extract()
		ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]
		paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)
		return paragraphs
	else:
		ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]
		paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)
		return paragraphs

# Main function
def main():
	with st.spinner('Classifying...'):
		global txt
		df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(
			by='Relevance Score', ascending=False)
		classify_topic_score = list(
			df_classify_topic['Topic'][:10])
		if input_type == 'Text':
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)
		elif input_type == 'URL':
			txt = req(url)
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)
		elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
			txt = ' '.join(all_txt)
			top_topics, scores = classify(
				txt, classify_topic_score)

	plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])
\`\`\`

There's a lot here so I'll break it down further.

The first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn't reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.

The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.

The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.

Here's how the model classified this blog post:

![A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score](/images/classification-labels.jpg)

The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars ([thanks to Jess for the help with that](https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604)) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.

The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.

### 3. Dictionaries

\`\`\`
kw_dict = {
	'Keyword': []
}

ent_dict = {
	'Keyword': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

topics_dict = {
	'Topic': [],
	'Relevance Score': [],
	'Existing Tag': []
}

categories_dict = {
	'Category': [],
	'Relevance Score': []
}

tags = {
	'Tag': [],
	'ID': [],
	'Count': []
}
\`\`\`

Arguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.

### 4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists

\`\`\`
# Blog list
blogs = ['sampleface.co.uk', 'cultrface.co.uk', 'logicface.co.uk', 'playrface.co.uk', 'distantarcade.co.uk']

# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs to go in
existing_tags = []
all_txt = []

# Upper limits for tag page range
upper_limits = {
	'sampleface.co.uk': 4,
	'cultrface.co.uk': 4,
	'logicface.co.uk': 2,
	'playrface.co.uk': 2,
	'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,
	'ld89.org': 1
}
\`\`\`

Here, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.

The tag data comes from WordPress's REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).

Also, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)

### 5. The Streamlit UI stuff

\`\`\`
# Streamlit stuff

st.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')

input_type = st.sidebar.radio('Select your input type', ['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])

update_tags = st.sidebar.button('\u21BB Refresh tags')

tag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')


# Determines input types
st.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')
st.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')
if input_type == 'Text':
	txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')
	txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('"', '').replace('\u201C','').replace('\u201D', '').replace('\u2018','').replace('\u2019', '').replace("'s", '').replace(",", '')
	st.write(len(txt))
elif input_type == 'URL':
	url = st.text_input('Enter URL')
elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')
\`\`\`

This displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.

### 6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress's REST API

\`\`\`
def update_all_tags():

	with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):

		for blog in blogs:
		
			# Get tag data
			for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):

				tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'
				r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)
				api_tags = r_tag.json()

				for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):
					tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])
					tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])
					tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])

				with open(f"{blog}.json", "w") as outfile:
					json.dump(tags, outfile)
			tags['Tag'] = []
			tags['ID'] = []
			tags['Count'] = []

list_of_blogs = st.radio("Select the corresponding blog", blogs)

# Load JSON files
with open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:
	blog_json = json.load(f)
	x = blog_json['Tag']
	for n in x:
		existing_tags.append(n)

submit = st.button('Submit')

if update_tags:
	update_all_tags()
\`\`\`

There are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won't change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.

From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.

### 7. The random functions for content ideas

\`\`\`
# Tag ideas functions

def sf_words():

	with open("sampleface.co.uk.json") as sf_json_file:
		sf = json.load(sf_json_file)

	for sample in range(5):
		with open("sampleface.co.uk.json") as sf_json_file:
			sf = json.load(sf_json_file)
		sf_words_count_lists = sf['Count']
		try:
			x = [n/(n+1) for n in sf_words_count_lists]
		except ZeroDivisionError:
			continue
			# sf_choices = random.choices(sf_words_count_lists, weights=(1/n), k=2)
		sample = random.choices(sf_words(), x, k=2)
		
		st.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))
	
def cultrface():

def all_blogs():

	sampleface()
	cultrface()
	logicface()
	playrface()
	distantarcade()
\`\`\`

I'll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs' tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags' counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.

Finally, they're all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.

### 8. The entity, topic, and category functions using the TextRazor API

\`\`\`
# Keyword extraction function to analyse with TextRazor

def textrazor_extraction(input_type):

	if input_type == 'Text':
		global txt
		response = client.analyze(txt)
		for entity in response.entities():
			if entity.relevance_score > 0:

				categories_dict['Relevance Score'].append(category.score)
\`\`\`

Depending on the input (text, URL, or multiple URLs), this function analyses the text, finds the topics, entities, and categories and adds them to a dictionary. I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it'll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It's worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!

### 9. The function for displaying that data in DataFrame form

\`\`\`
# DataFrames to present above data
def data_viz():

	if input_type == 'Text':

		# df_kw = pd.DataFrame(kw_dict)
		# # grouped_df_kw = df_kw.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		# # grouped_df_kw = grouped_df_kw.reset_index()
		# st.header('Keywords')
		# st.dataframe(df_kw)

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'URL':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean'], 'Existing Tag': ['max']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby(['Category']).agg({'Relevance Score': ['mean']}).round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)

	elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':

		df_ent = pd.DataFrame(ent_dict)
		grouped_df_ent = df_ent.groupby(['Keyword', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_ent = grouped_df_ent.reset_index()
		st.header('Entities')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_ent)

		df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
		grouped_df_topic = df_topic.groupby(['Topic', 'Existing Tag']).describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_topic = grouped_df_topic.reset_index()
		st.header('Topics')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_topic)

		df_cat = pd.DataFrame(categories_dict)
		grouped_df_cat = df_cat.groupby('Category').describe().round(3)
		grouped_df_cat = grouped_df_cat.reset_index()
		st.header('Categories')
		st.dataframe(grouped_df_cat)
\`\`\`

The penultimate function converts those dictionaries into dataframes. The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I've used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.

Below is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Keyword     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| Website      					| 0.6620       	  | 0			 |
| Search engine optimization    | 0.6460          | 0			 |
| Web scraping					| 0.6450		  | 0			 |
| World Wide Website			| 0.6440		  | 0			 |
| HTML							| 0.6320		  | 0			 |

A table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Topic     					| Relevance Score | Existing tag |
| -----------------------------	| --------------- | ------------ |
| API      						| 1.0000       	  | 0			 |

| Computer science				| 1.0000		  | 1			 |
| Computing						| 1.0000		  | 0			 |
| Google Search					| 1.0000		  | 0			 |

And a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:

| Category     																	| Relevance Score |
| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	| --------------- |
| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology      		| 0.8100		  |

### 10. Execution of the all the functions to make it work

\`\`\`
# Execute functions
if tag_ideas:
	all_blogs()
elif submit and input_type and input_type == 'Text':
	textrazor_extraction('Text')
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'URL':
	textrazor_extraction('URL')
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == 'Multiple URLs':
	urls = [line for line in multi_url.split("\\n")]
	textrazor_extraction('Multiple URLs')
	data_viz()
\`\`\`

Finally, we have all the functions ready to call, depending on whether I'm analysing raw text or URLs.

<h2 id="who_could_this_benefit">Who could this benefit?</h2>

As I said earlier, I've made this mainly for myself and as a way to improve my taxonomies. I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow ([also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago](/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/)).

But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:

* To analyse text for entity relevance
* To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)
* Content ideas
* To check if your text is aligned how you want it

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

This Python script is not perfect. It's rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.

One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn't fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.

There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I've been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don't like to say "hey, I made this thing" because who cares (that's what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.`, "html": '<p>I\u2019ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they\u2019ve changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I\u2019ve decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to do it as it\u2019s very niche to me but I\u2019ve taken a step out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/lukedavisseo/ralts">GitHub link to RALTS repository</a></p>\n<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="#ralts">What is RALTS?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</a></li>\n<li><a href="#some_definitions">Some definitions</a></li>\n<li><a href="#tech_requirements">Tech requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href="#the_code">The code</a></li>\n<li><a href="#who_could_this_benefit">Who could this benefit?</a></li>\n<li><a href="#evaluation">Evaluation</a></li>\n<li><a href="#summary">Summary</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2>\n<p>RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it\u2019s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I\u2019ll explain those all in more detail later.</p>\n<p>There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I\u2019ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema">https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow">https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry">https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring">https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs">https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I\u2019m a Pok\xE9mon fan.

I\u2019m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn\u2019t think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.</p>\n<h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2>\n<p>Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I\u2019ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I\u2019ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven\u2019t finished. You\u2019ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for \u201Cstupid code\u201D and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).</p>\n<p>I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his <a href="https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo">zero shot demo</a>. He wrote a great piece on <a href="https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html">zero shot learning</a> which you should read if you\u2019re interested.</p>\n<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/">There\u2019s also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action</a>.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019ve taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I\u2019ve forgotten to credit or if you\u2019d prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.</p>\n<h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2>\n<p>So, about that original explanation. Let\u2019s look at some definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \u201Can automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\u201D.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Categories - The term \u201Ccategories\u201D is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They\u2019re basically like tags.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2>\n<p>These are the following Python packages used in the script:</p>\n<pre is:raw class="astro-code" style="background-color: #0d1117; overflow-x: auto;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">streamlit&gt;=1.0.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">pandas&gt;=1.2.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">transformers&gt;=4.12.3</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">requests&gt;=2.25.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">bs4&gt;=0.0.1</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">plotly&gt;=5.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">numpy&gt;=1.18.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">textrazor==1.4.0</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">tensorflow&gt;=2.7.0</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> for the UI, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for data manipulation, <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines">Transformers</a> for the language model, requests and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> for web scraping, <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> for data viz, <a href="https://www.textrazor.com/">TextRazor</a> for the entities and such, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> for the language model.</p>\n<p>Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I\u2019m using is called <a href="https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9">DistilBart-MNLI</a> and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.</p>\n<h2 id="the_code">The code</h2>\n<p>The code is split into different parts:</p>\n<h3 id="1-textrazor-api-key-and-client-details">1.

This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the model classified this blog post:</p>\n<p><img src="/images/classification-labels.jpg" alt="A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about.

It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604">thanks to Jess for the help with that</a>) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.</p>\n<h3 id="3-dictionaries">3.

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won\u2019t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.</p>\n<p>From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.</p>\n<h3 id="7-the-random-functions-for-content-ideas">7.

To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags\u2019 counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method.

I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow (<a href="/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/">also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago</a>).</p>\n<p>But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To analyse text for entity relevance</li>\n<li>To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)</li>\n<li>Content ideas</li>\n<li>To check if your text is aligned how you want it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>\n<p>This Python script is not perfect. It\u2019s rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.</p>\n<p>One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn\u2019t fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.</p>\n<p>There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.</p>\n<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I\u2019ve been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don\u2019t like to say \u201Chey, I made this thing\u201D because who cares (that\u2019s what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.</p>' } };

</ol><h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2><p>RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it’s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I’ll explain those all in more detail later.</p><p>There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I’ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema">https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema</a></li>

</ul><p>In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I’m a Pokémon fan. It’s a backronym but it works for me.</p><h2 id="why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</h2><p>tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.</p><p>I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I’m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).</p><p>Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn’t think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.</p><h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2><p>Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I’ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I’ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven’t finished. You’ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for “stupid code” and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).</p><p>I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his <a href="https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo">zero shot demo</a>. He wrote a great piece on <a href="https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html">zero shot learning</a> which you should read if you’re interested.</p><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/">There’s also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action</a>.</p><p>If I’ve taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I’ve forgotten to credit or if you’d prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.</p><h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2><p>So, about that original explanation. Let’s look at some definitions:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has “an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Categories - The term “categories” is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They’re basically like tags.</p>
</li>

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won’t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.</p><p>From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.</p><h3 id="7-the-random-functions-for-content-ideas">7.

To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags’ counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.</p><p>Finally, they’re all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.</p><h3 id="8-the-entity-topic-and-category-functions-using-the-textrazor-api">8.

I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it’ll give me a 1 or 0 if not.

I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow (<a href="/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/">also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago</a>).</p><p>But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:</p><ul>
<li>To analyse text for entity relevance</li>
<li>To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)</li>
<li>Content ideas</li>
<li>To check if your text is aligned how you want it</li>
</ul><h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2><p>This Python script is not perfect. It’s rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.</p><p>One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn’t fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.</p><p>There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I’ve been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don’t like to say “hey, I made this thing” because who cares (that’s what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.</p>` })}`;

This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn't going to publish anything. My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won't do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there's no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that's a vast improvement on 2016, the **Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.**

## Accepting My Mental Health Problems and Getting Help

Being a mathematician at heart, I like to think of things in analytical terms. Using a scale of 0-10, I'd give this year an average of 3 and a variance of 5. There have been peaks but plenty of troughs and it's been hell trying to navigate through them. Anyone who follows me on Twitter will have seen my tweets on mental health and some on my own personal life. Despite this, I find it difficult to write about my life in this form. But here we are. People have often remarked at my cool exterior even in moments where others would feel stress. I never used to notice it but now I make sure to maintain this for my own peace of mind. Unfortunately, all that goes out of the window when I enter a stressful situation where I'm tasked with resolving that turmoil. Over the last few years, I have developed anxiety laced with bouts of depression. I've had difficulty controlling my anger during arguments and stressful situations, resorting to the foulest of comments for which I'm ashamed. But anger isn't to blame. I am the sole culprit. Hitting rock bottom leaves you with two choices: stay there for good or find your way back up. I chose the latter. I self referred back to a counselling service and received [CBT](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/) for the first time. I'd received mixed reviews on its effectiveness but I knew it was the appropriate action for my problems. I didn't need medications and anything less than CBT (which I got last December) would have been useless. I had a lovely counsellor who listened and gave me the tools I needed and some food for thought: I needed to be more assertive. It's all a work in progress so I'll let you know at the end of 2018 how I've been doing with that.

## Learning To Be Comfortable Alone After A Breakup

I started the year with a breakup. It was meant to be The Relationship but it hadn't been right for a long time. I played my part and I'm still haunted by some of my actions. I've reached a comfortable plateau with that after a few torrid months in the middle of the year. But amongst all the mess, I learnt how to be okay on my own. I got my own place (more on that later) and found solace in my own space. I still feel lonely at times but then I remember what certain kinds of company I desired would mean and I came to appreciate the environment I was in. I had time to work on my own projects, make my own meals or order in, go out if/when I wanted to - living my life. It was the first time in my life I'd lived on my own and I wouldn't trade it for anything right now. I don't know what the future holds for my love life. I've often segued into relationships or had long stretches being single but yearning for someone but I've not had that this time. Who knows what 2018 will bring. Again, I'll keep you posted.

## Getting My Own Place

I spent the first seven months of the year living with my sister. The change in environment was helpful and I'm so grateful to my sister for that comfort. But I still needed to find my own place. After 6 viewings, I found something 10 minutes from my sister's house and I've loved the place ever since. It's a first floor flat in one of the poshest areas in the city but it's been a dream to live here since I moved. The decor is simple and to my favourite colour scheme: white and grey. It can feel lonely sometimes but it's my home and welcome relief from work. I've laughed to myself more there than I have in years. It's mine.

## I'm Certified, Baby!

My job hunt has been a nightmare. I've applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I'd passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we'll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I'll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I'll win the race in 2018.

## I Got A Break

Lisbon. What a city. [I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine](/post/my-week-in-lisbon/) and the week away was the best time I've ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally "be". Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I've ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That's my new "soul hub".

## Could "Pandog Media" Be The Answer?

I've been [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) for years and started [Sampleface](https://sampleface.co.uk) as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started [Cultrface](https://cultrface.co.uk). This year, I started [LOGiCFACE](https://logicface.co.uk) (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and [Playrface](https://playrface.co.uk). But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that's where Pandog Media came from. It's only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It's often suggested to blog in your free time if you can't get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I've also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I'm tired of that and I want that to change. I don't know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I'll take them on instead.

So that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.`, "html": '<p>This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn\u2019t going to publish anything.

This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn't going to publish anything. My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won't do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there's no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that's a vast improvement on 2016, the **Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.**

## I'm Certified, Baby!

My job hunt has been a nightmare. I've applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I'd passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we'll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I'll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I'll win the race in 2018.

## I Got A Break

Lisbon. What a city. [I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine](/post/my-week-in-lisbon/) and the week away was the best time I've ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally "be". Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I've ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That's my new "soul hub".

## Could "Pandog Media" Be The Answer?

I've been [blogging](/wiki/blogging/) for years and started [Sampleface](https://sampleface.co.uk) as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started [Cultrface](https://cultrface.co.uk). This year, I started [LOGiCFACE](https://logicface.co.uk) (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and [Playrface](https://playrface.co.uk). But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that's where Pandog Media came from. It's only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It's often suggested to blog in your free time if you can't get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I've also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter.

I'm tired of that and I want that to change. I don't know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I'll take them on instead.

So that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.`, "html": '<p>This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn\u2019t going to publish anything.

It’s mine.</p><h2 id="im-certified-baby">I’m Certified, Baby!</h2><p>My job hunt has been a nightmare. I’ve applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I’d passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we’ll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I’ll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I’ll win the race in 2018.</p><h2 id="i-got-a-break">I Got A Break</h2><p>Lisbon. What a city. <a href="/post/my-week-in-lisbon/">I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine</a> and the week away was the best time I’ve ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally “be”. Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I’ve ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That’s my new “soul hub”.</p><h2 id="could-pandog-media-be-the-answer">Could “Pandog Media” Be The Answer?</h2><p>I’ve been <a href="/wiki/blogging/">blogging</a> for years and started <a href="https://sampleface.co.uk">Sampleface</a> as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started <a href="https://cultrface.co.uk">Cultrface</a>. This year, I started <a href="https://logicface.co.uk">LOGiCFACE</a> (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and <a href="https://playrface.co.uk">Playrface</a>. But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that’s where Pandog Media came from. It’s only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It’s often suggested to blog in your free time if you can’t get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I’ve also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I’m tired of that and I want that to change. I don’t know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I’ll take them on instead.</p><p>So that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.</p>` })}`;

It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\n\nThe inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I've made in years. When I decided this, I hadn't considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March's edition of [Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/). They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation's virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I'd visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I'd travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents' house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn't go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn't bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn't realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was \u20AC345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the [Estadio Jose Alvalade](https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade). The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night's sleep in months, if not years.\n\n## Tuesday - Ter\xE7a-feira\n\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn't included but at \u20AC7 a day, it was great value. I didn't fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I'd mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I'm back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at [Italian Burger & Lobster House](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn't until 7:45pm. I'd picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only \u20AC0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/). There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of _[pasteis de nata](https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html)_ for the first time - Lisbon's delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn't too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only \u20AC6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I'd only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn't any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium's station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I've ever had.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for \u20AC3) and stayed in my room all day. I'd been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn't anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn't regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a _[b\xF6rek](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe)_ for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn't a total waste and I got some new clothes.\n\n## Friday - Sexta-feira\n\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit [MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)](https://www.maat.pt). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It's reminscient of Birmingham's Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Bel\xE9m coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called [Las Ficheras](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\n\n## Saturday - S\xE1bado\n\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn't stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Bel\xE9m for the [Museu Cole\xE7\xE3o Berardo](https://en.museuberardo.pt/), a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Bel\xE9m which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn't surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dal\xED and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at [Este Oeste](https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/), a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life. \n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contempor\xE2nea do Chiado (or **MNAC** for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) since entry was only \u20AC4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren't to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A \u20AC13 buffet wasn't to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I've since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I'd ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Ingl\xE9s, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for \u20AC4. That's when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents' nearest station. Metro rides were \u20AC1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over \xA35.\n\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That's why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I'd been in 5 years. It's definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I'd love to live in the future. I wasn't able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.", "html": '<p><img src="/images/MAAT-Lisbon-Amanda-Levet-Architects-0016_1.png" alt="MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)"></p>\n<p>From 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon.

It\u2019s definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I\u2019d love to live in the future. I wasn\u2019t able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.</p>' };

It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\n\nThe inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I've made in years. When I decided this, I hadn't considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March's edition of [Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/). They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation's virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I'd visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I'd travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents' house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn't go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn't bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn't realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was \u20AC345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the [Estadio Jose Alvalade](https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade). The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night's sleep in months, if not years.\n\n## Tuesday - Ter\xE7a-feira\n\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn't included but at \u20AC7 a day, it was great value. I didn't fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I'd mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I'm back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at [Italian Burger & Lobster House](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn't until 7:45pm. I'd picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only \u20AC0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/). There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of _[pasteis de nata](https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html)_ for the first time - Lisbon's delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn't too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only \u20AC6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I'd only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn't any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium's station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I've ever had.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for \u20AC3) and stayed in my room all day. I'd been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn't anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn't regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a _[b\xF6rek](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe)_ for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn't a total waste and I got some new clothes.\n\n## Friday - Sexta-feira\n\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit [MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)](https://www.maat.pt). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It's reminscient of Birmingham's Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Bel\xE9m coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called [Las Ficheras](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\n\n## Saturday - S\xE1bado\n\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn't stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Bel\xE9m for the [Museu Cole\xE7\xE3o Berardo](https://en.museuberardo.pt/), a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Bel\xE9m which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn't surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dal\xED and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at [Este Oeste](https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/), a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life. \n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contempor\xE2nea do Chiado (or **MNAC** for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) since entry was only \u20AC4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren't to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A \u20AC13 buffet wasn't to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I've since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I'd ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Ingl\xE9s, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for \u20AC4. That's when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents' nearest station. Metro rides were \u20AC1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over \xA35.\n\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That's why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I'd been in 5 years. It's definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I'd love to live in the future.

The only other European cities I'd visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I'd travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents' house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn't go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn't bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn't realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was \u20AC345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the [Estadio Jose Alvalade](https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade). The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night's sleep in months, if not years.\n\n## Tuesday - Ter\xE7a-feira\n\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn't included but at \u20AC7 a day, it was great value. I didn't fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I'd mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I'm back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at [Italian Burger & Lobster House](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn't until 7:45pm. I'd picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only \u20AC0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/). There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of _[pasteis de nata](https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html)_ for the first time - Lisbon's delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn't too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only \u20AC6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I'd only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn't any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium's station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I've ever had.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for \u20AC3) and stayed in my room all day. I'd been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn't anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn't regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a _[b\xF6rek](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe)_ for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn't a total waste and I got some new clothes.\n\n## Friday - Sexta-feira\n\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit [MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)](https://www.maat.pt). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It's reminscient of Birmingham's Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Bel\xE9m coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called [Las Ficheras](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\n\n## Saturday - S\xE1bado\n\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn't stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Bel\xE9m for the [Museu Cole\xE7\xE3o Berardo](https://en.museuberardo.pt/), a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Bel\xE9m which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn't surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dal\xED and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at [Este Oeste](https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/), a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life. \n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contempor\xE2nea do Chiado (or **MNAC** for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) since entry was only \u20AC4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren't to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A \u20AC13 buffet wasn't to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I've since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I'd ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Ingl\xE9s, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for \u20AC4. That's when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents' nearest station. Metro rides were \u20AC1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over \xA35.\n\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That's why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I'd been in 5 years. It's definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I'd love to live in the future. I wasn't able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.", "html": '<p><img src="/images/MAAT-Lisbon-Amanda-Levet-Architects-0016_1.png" alt="MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)"></p>\n<p>From 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon.

I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of <em><a href="https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html">pasteis de nata</a></em> for the first time - Lisbon’s delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn’t too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only €6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I’d only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn’t any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium’s station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I’ve ever had.</p><h2 id="thursday---quinta-feira">Thursday - Quinta-feira</h2><p>I woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&#x26;M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for €3) and stayed in my room all day. I’d been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn’t anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn’t regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a <em><a href="https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe">börek</a></em> for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn’t a total waste and I got some new clothes.</p><h2 id="friday---sexta-feira">Friday - Sexta-feira</h2><p>No rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit <a href="https://www.maat.pt">MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)</a>. It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It’s reminscient of Birmingham’s Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Belém coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html">Las Ficheras</a>. Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.</p><h2 id="saturday---sábado">Saturday - Sábado</h2><p>The rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn’t stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Belém for the <a href="https://en.museuberardo.pt/">Museu Coleção Berardo</a>, a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Belém which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn’t surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dalí and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/">Este Oeste</a>, a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life.</p><h2 id="sunday---domingo">Sunday - Domingo</h2><p>My last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado (or <strong>MNAC</strong> for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya) since entry was only €4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren’t to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A €13 buffet wasn’t to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I’ve since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I’d ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the São Sebastião station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Inglés, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for €4. That’s when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.</p><h2 id="monday---segunda-feira-1">Monday - Segunda-feira</h2><p>I bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents’ nearest station. Metro rides were €1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over £5.</p><p>As I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That’s why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I’d been in 5 years. It’s definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I’d love to live in the future. I wasn’t able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.</p>` })}`;

<p>I can't believe it's been 9 years. I remember where I was and what I was doing that evening and for the next few days trying to process it all. One of the most surreal weeks of my life. I'd only become a fan in 2003 after watching this video but it changed my life, no exaggeration:</p>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU

<p>I've told this story about a million times but I'm gonna tell it again. I was on the floor watching TV in my parents' house. The advert had been on before but I'd not really paid attention but this time I did. Because it was 2003, Michael was past his "commercial prime" as it were. Invincible was undersold to his standards and the allegations had ruined him along with his plastic surgery and vitiligo (perceived as skin bleaching to make himself white.) The tabloids had crushed him and he just wasn't the same. My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I'd never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn't until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was "WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn't human!" but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn't keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life. From that very moment on, I <strong>NEEDED</strong> that CD, I needed to see that advert again and I needed everything he made. This was before YouTube existed so I had to wait for the advert to be on TV and eventually it happened and I was awestruck again.</p>           
<p>After getting the Number Ones album, I got Dangerous, then HIStory and the obsession continued. I started playing my mum's records when my parents were out. I'd practice the Billie Jean dance routine from my sister's video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiP9kPEpZ4">this one</a>) to the point where I warped the carpets and they had to be replaced (my parents never found out the real reason why.) I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I'd never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn't believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I'd never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I'd revered and loved so much - gone. It took a few years before I came to terms with it although to some degree, it'll always take me aback.</p>

<p>Thank you, Michael Jackson. You inspired so many with your work and your art in its purest form.</p>

Your fave could never.

But if you don’t deal with things, they accumulate and I am the product of that accumulation.</p><p>I’ve never felt like I’ve had the “luxury” of grieving when I’ve had to carry on. Some days, you just want to curl in a ball and not leave that spot for days. I guess I have done that before. But the fear of being asked about it by loved ones often pulls me out. <em>Maybe it wasn’t that bad then</em>. But it becomes grief deferred or sustained grief as bell hooks described it. And because of how society works, the solution is always a book or a chat or a change in diet or a walk. But you’ll read with that grief, chat with that grief, eat with that grief, walk with that grief, and sleep with that grief. And you learn to live with it; to function <em>somehow</em>. I’m still here so I’ve not done too badly but I know I could do so much better.</p>` })}`;

Happy new year. Sort of.

I took a couple of weeks off from my main Twitter account as it was getting too much and I knew the holiday period would be difficult for my mental health (spoiler alert: it was).

I'm kinda back but I'm not tweeting as much because I'm still uncomfortable about it. All the talk about the pandemic, the meta-discourse about the pandemic, and marketing industry chat is a lot to jump back into. I also don't give a crap about marketing right now. I will still do work to the best of my ability and I still enjoy the technicalities of what SEO is/should be about but the constant talk about tips and ideas\u2014regurgitated from the same places offering little to no tangible solutions or actions for people to work with\u2014drain me. My peers do it or share it and I just find it dull and annoying. Not sorry.

To be honest, most of the overall online chat I'm seeing is grating on me and I can't spend too long "logged on". And to that end, I'm beyond tired again and while I've told people I'm okay (because I am physically and logistically), mentally I'm not and I haven't been since March last year when this all kicked off. I know I need therapy but not CBT this time and I'll try to seek that this year. I've lost things dear to me and I have a lot of unresolved issues to overcome and reconcile with. I also have a son to look after amongst all this shit.

So if you're reading this and got this far, you don't have to tell me you're "there for me" or anything. I don't know who or when to talk to anyone just yet (unless you're a Black therapist, in which case let's talk!) and ultimately, I want to be left alone to feel better and hope I can someday leave the house and maybe even my city for something other than a COVID test or an alternative Christmas.

I've noticed something about how I approach [blogging](/wiki/blogging/). "Wearing many hats" is an idiom that means having different jobs or roles and running multiple blogs lends itself to that ideal. My head is never cold.

<li><a href="https://sampleface.co.uk/">Sampleface</a>: hard hat - writing reviews of any kind is difficult as I struggle to find words to describe music. More “generic” stuff is easier to write about so I gravitate towards that when I update the site.</li>
<li><a href="https://cultrface.co.uk/">Cultrface</a>: wide brim fedora - I get more excited about writing for Cultrface because the gamut is so wide. The only thing that stops me from updating it more is the the thing that stops me from writing in general. Well, <em>things</em>: fatigue, procrastination, anxiety, depression, the fact I can’t churn out amazing content in 5 minutes so what’s the point. The usual.</li>
<li><a href="https://logicface.co.uk/">LOG!CFACE</a>: chullo - I need to be in the mood to write about STEM. It’s definitely not a lack of ideas, just a lack of motivation and mood. I actually get traffic for some niche topics so the impetus <em>should</em> be there. But for reasons why it isn’t, see above.</li>
<li><a href="https://playrface.co.uk/">Playrface</a>: Nike Dri-fit Head Tie, I get a similar feeling writing for Playrface as I do for Cultrface despite lacking critical or technical knowledge of sport. I know what I know and most of it is about tennis and soccer. Anything else I’m just curious and write about those curiosities. Most of the content is about <a href="/post/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/">Federer</a> or Championship Manager and the latter brings in the most traffic. Go figure.</li>
</ul><p>I have other blogs. They rarely get updated due to extreme versions of the above problem. And this one just gets random musings when I can be bothered. Like this one. No hat required. Just words.</p>` })}`;

const metadata$r = { "headers": [], "source": "\nEarlier this week, I read about a concept called [Idea Debt](https://jessicaabel.com/idea-debt/). It\u2019s when you hold onto ideas without actually putting them into place and as they build up, you\u2019re left with an increasing number of unfulfilled concepts. I suffer from this badly. In my late teens, I came up with an idea for a fantasy novel. Ten years later, I still have a \u201Cbinder of lore\u201D, along with another of my ideas \u2013 **_Hyperman_**, a superhero kept alive by radium gas (yes, that highly volatile, highly toxic gas). While the later was conjured from a bored Sunday afternoon and will never become anything more than a poor drawing, I\u2019d love to make a go of the novel. But it\u2019s not going to happen. I have more high quality ideas from the past few weeks to ignore.\n\nMy debt continues to build.\n\nThe posited solution to all this is to work in the moment and that\u2019s what I do. New ideas blossom pretty quickly in my head but soon take over like wild weeds. The negative connotations are on purpose; I become wrapped up and prioritise it over anything else, usually daily necessities like eating and cleaning. This wouldn\u2019t sound so bad except my ideas **_never go further than my own outlets_**. For the music I make, I\u2019ve been very lucky to make some money from it and received good feedback from my peers. Other than that, I get nothing other than momentary satisfaction. This adds interest to the Idea Debt but fortunately this is simple interest as it doesn\u2019t hamper my creative desire for the next project.\n\nAs I sit here thinking of all the ideas I\u2019ve ever had and a debt that won\u2019t go away, I wonder what would happen if I just set them free. Would one of those creative buds be better suited with someone else? I\u2019d like to think so. As a species, we are very clingy to the products of our thoughts. We\u2019re afraid to share them in case of theft and in some cases, I feel we\u2019re right to do so but not always. What use is a brilliant idea if it\u2019s not being used? Holding on tightly to an idea you\u2019re almost certain of leaving in the corner of your mind is just a waste of brain power. Why not pass it onto someone you know and trust? If you really can\u2019t bear to give it away, you have to use it.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I plan to do.

2017 has been up and down but one thing has stuck out: I need to be moving forward. I've seen a lot of people progressing and I've been still.

I'm still single (less said about that the better) and despite the qualification, my long term career plans remain as "plans" despite efforts to change it.

But I won't be defeated. My life is to be lived and I won't stagnate any longer.

## This is The Luke 100.

It's a list of 100 things I want to do in my life.

My list is complete and I'm ready to get to work on it. Everything is split into three categories: things that require skills, time, and things I can do right away. I've decided to add an extra category: things that require money (because these are investments after all).

I'm working on a website for this but in the meantime, you can find the list on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PrJ6Xe9bisJD9phiwR1O7hSbZCaIaa9Qs4jh50Fqvj4/edit?usp=sharing).

## RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS

WHEREAS, 95 percent of all the e-mail received by critics and columnists is civil, friendly or respectfully constructive;

but WHEREAS, this is the Internet age, and we're all anonymous and can avoid making eye contact forever;

and WHEREAS, there's so much information overload, a little heat and drama on your part may be necessary just to be heard above the din;

and WHEREAS, many of those who fire off potshots are missing out on some of the best techniques for effective snippiness;

THEREFORE let us now post the rules for membership in the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society.

1. Use the strongest language possible. Calling names is always effective, and four-letter words show that you mean business.

2. Having a violent opinion of something doesn't require you to actually try it yourself. After all, plenty of people heatedly object to books they haven't read or movies they haven't seen. Heck, you can imagine perfectly well if something is any good.

3. If it's a positive review that you didn't like, call the reviewer a "fanboy." Do not entertain the notion that the product, service, show, movie, book or restaurant might, in fact, be good. Instead, assume that the reviewer has received payment from the reviewee. Work in the word "shill" if possible.

4. If it's a negative review, call the reviewer a "basher" and describe the review as a "hatchet job." Accuse him of being paid off by the reviewee's _rival_.

5. If it's a mixed review, ignore the passages that balance the argument. Pretend that the entire review is all positive or all negative. Refer to it either as a "rave" or a "slam."

6. If you find a sentence early in the article that rubs you the wrong way, you are by no means obligated to finish reading. Stop right where you are--express your anger while it's still good and hot! What are the odds that the writer is going to say anything else relevant to your point later in the piece, anyway?

7. If the writer responds to your e-mail with evidence that you're wrong (for example, by citing a paragraph that you overlooked), disappear without responding. This is the anonymous Internet; slipping away without consequence or civility is your privilege.

8. Trolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.

9. Don't let generalities slip by. Don't tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience. Ignore conditional words like "generally," "usually" and "most." If you read a sentence that says, for example, "The VisionPhone is among the first consumer videophones," cite the reviewer's ignorance and laziness for failing to mention the prototype developed by AT&T for the 1964 World's Fair. Send copies of your note to the publication's publisher and, if possible, its advertisers.

(14 years later, it's only got worse.)

<p>Trolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t let generalities slip by. Don’t tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience. Ignore conditional words like “generally,” “usually” and “most.” If you read a sentence that says, for example, “The VisionPhone is among the first consumer videophones,” cite the reviewer’s ignorance and laziness for failing to mention the prototype developed by AT&#x26;T for the 1964 World’s Fair. Send copies of your note to the publication’s publisher and, if possible, its advertisers.</p>

It is a weaponised concept and it is a blanket of community. In the right hands, those tired hands passed down by ancestors, it can revolt and rejoice through the pain of its history. In the wrong hands, those clean hands of oppressors, its coloured connotations are brought to the forefront; darkness, blacklisted, blacked out, evil. It is misconstrued as a binary system - the one drop rule has never died, just changed its visage. There is no percentage competition with <a href="/wiki/black/">blackness</a> but it is used as such. What is “HALF-caste” really? There are gradients to this rhetoric but blackness isn’t a rhetoric. No one can “speak” in Blackness as a single entity for the truth is blackness is composed of numerous planes. The fact I speak of Blackness now in this language – my native tongue – betrays its true origins and yet represents its history so well. The English language is a melting pot of others, tracing centuries of raping and pillaging from other lands, taking words and refashioning them as “loan words” that have never been returned (much like artefacts of Blackness on those English language museums). The words I utter to describe this unfathomably large concept were given to my ancestors by force but without those words, I could not sit down to speak of Blackness. What a conundrum!</p><p>But I must refine them. I must celebrate the champions of Blackness from centuries ago, in the present, and what lies in the future. For those who suffered, suffer, and will suffer after me. It is crucial to inform that Blackness is not a proportion of melanin. Skin colour is a vice we all hold but it is not a defining rod or rule of judgement. Blackness transcends this all. But I am not equipped to be that judge. There are anthologies of work that can do better than me. I am merely a sentence worth. But with one sentence comes another, into a paragraph, a page, a chapter, a book, a series, a shelf, a library. This is the power of Blackness. To start from so small, under the foot of the oppressors and shout what we feel and what should be heard. This is what fuels movements like Black Lives Matter – because they all matter and this is why. The anger you see and hear? It is valid and necessary. It cannot be destroyed or extinguished as that would break the laws of the conservation of energy, laws we all follow. Covering up blackness is futile. Weaponising it has consequences, more severe with time. For those who suffer them (and I loathe to use the word “suffer” in this context), they must learn the hard way. But it is necessary.</p><p>I feel I have rambled. The truth is I cannot define blackness into a neat dictionary term. That would be the most heinous crime; an assault committed by oppressors who point to the book to prove they aren’t racist. But that book is written by them. “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house” said Audre Lorde. How can we determine whether the tools of Black people are truly ours or those of the master? That perhaps is another question and another I cannot answer. But we can certain refrain from using the most overt devices. Repurpose and refresh. We have achieved relative success in the form of language. I admire the reversal of meaning in the English language. It fascinates and saddens me in equal measure. The sadness comes from its use by non-Black people to attack or profit. Or complete ignorance in the form of active erasure. Why should Chaucer and Shakespeare be lauded and rappers be denigrated? They are modern-day griots and their stories use said master’s tools with such brilliance to attack them.</p>` })}`;

Tonight, I deactivated from Twitter. It's only for the night although if tomorrow is as bad as today, I'll extend it.

It started with the Meghan Markle interview with Oprah. If her saddening accounts of experiencing racism\u2014towards herself and her son\u2014and suicidal thoughts weren't bad enough, people were exploiting the situation for Twitter coverage. After getting called out (by me and a Black woman), a couple of the tweets I saw were deleted.

Then there was the shitty "women belong in the kitchen" tweet from Burger King which was meant to be a clickbait opener to stating the company's committment to better gender representation. Not cool. "Ironic" sexism is just sexism.

And speaking of questionable mentions of gender representation, I saw more conflations of International Women's Day and being a woman with being non-binary. They are not the same. You can't just say "women and non-binary people" if non-binary people haven't called for it and not on a day that isn't for them.

Ultimately, today has shown a lot of people for the fake allies they are (if they were even allies to begin with). I tweeted my 2 cents and bounced for the night. I won't feel a way about making it longer and I have a feeling I might.

Think of any multi-billion dollar company and you'll remember their successes. After all, that's how they made all that money, right? But for every successful business, there have been a lot of failures which would have bankrupted or otherwise ruined other businesses\u2013or people for that matter (and they probably have but why spoil a successful capitalist story).

In a recent work interview, I was asked what success looked like for me. It felt like a more helpful version of "where do you see yourself in five years?" and I found it easier to answer. But for a while, I've thought about the epic failures from the likes of Disney, Apple, Microsoft, and Sir Richard Branson (to name a few) and how they've been glossed over because they're worth trillions between them. Even if those failures were proportionally scaled to smaller businesses or people, they'd be seen as cautionary tales and seen for what they were - failures.

Why is failure seen as admirable risk-taking for some people but comical mismanagement for others? If we're asked to define our own successes, we should be able to define our own failures and there shouldn't be a hierarchal disparity.

I've focussed a lot on business for these examples but it might be clearer to see the differences when we look at politics. Take a look at Boris Johnson. His failures have involved the deaths of thousands of people, racism against thousands more, and a general apathy towards people who aren't rich Tories (emphasis on rich because he doesn't give a shit about working or middle class Tory voters despite the rhetoric). Now look at Diane Abbott, a Black woman and trailblazing MP who is seens as incompetent and foolish for merely existing. People take pride in laughing at her and pointing at her faults and the moment you point out the misogynoir, they get heated and play the reverse race card.

If we're going to define our successes or failures, we need to take into account:

- The effect on ourselves
- The effect on other people
- What we accomplished
- What we learnt
- Probably some other stuff I've forgotten because I'm not a sage

It all stopped by the time I was 22/23.</p>\n\n<p>But my second attempt was successful. I tried for a graphic design degree but the interviewer suggested a foundation course. My other option was a 3-year music technology degree. No interview required. It combined the technological aspect from computer science and, of course, music. My choice was obvious. First year was a breeze but second year was more serious. I needed to try and make connections before I left. In the summer, I got in touch with a record label looking for a digital media assistant. Coincidentally, a long-time friend was also working there. They invited me to the office and I got thrown in the deep end. I arrived with full blown hayfever symptoms. My nose was streaming and I was running out of tissues fast. But I survived and I got the job. I spent the next year there between lectures and seminars. It started out with admin and later progressed into blog writing and ad-hoc design work. I became a jack of all trades and enjoyed working with friends and laughter. I was living the dream. But all good things must come to an end and they did. The company was haemorrhaging money. Wages weren\u2019t paid, solicitors came, friends left. I didn\u2019t pursue legal action but I left after a week of non-payment and never went back.</p>\n\n<p>I stole one of their Twitter accounts as moral payback and transformed it into something of my own. But before I left, I started work on a blog and called it Sampleface. The name came from a friend who used it to describe the face you make when you hear a song you think you could sample. We worked on it together and after we all parted ways, I continued writing for it. I enjoyed immersing myself in the music and the writing. Music had saved me from spiralling depression I\u2019d developed at uni the first time. It was all so cathartic and exciting. But I couldn\u2019t find any paid work in a similar way. I graduated with a 2:1 and went on to work in a post office. I kept writing. My then-girlfriend helped and organised interviews with artists. I got to speak to some of my idols and even met one for a face-to-face interview on my birthday weekend. I\u2019ll never forget that. But then the writing slowed down.\nA seed of doubt was planted in my mind and it never stopped growing. I was asked why I was doing what I was doing if there were other people doing the same thing. As someone who sucks at defending themselves, I didn\u2019t have a clear answer so I said nothing. And I let it get to me. Then I found a full-time job where my girlfriend lived and I moved up to Nottingham. I was drifting away from what I felt I should be doing. But I needed to eat and live.</p>\n\n<p>But I kept on writing.</p>\n\n<p>There was the odd freelance project here and there. Interviews that amounted to nothing. I tried but maybe not hard enough. There was time off work for stress and anxiety. A new baby on the way. Arguments and increased stress and anxiety. 2015 was hell for me. 2016 wasn\u2019t much better. My son was the only thing I lived for after he was born. But I still wrote when I found the time. And then a big life change. I moved out on my own. Writing was a weekly thing if I was lucky. It used to be a daily thing. By 2017, I\u2019d been writing for Sampleface for 5 years. I\u2019d started a couple more blogs in that time.\n\n<p>And then a breakthrough.</p>\n\n<p>A friend contacted me about a possible freelance project. And paid. I was working part time and the money came in handy. It also meant some writing experience. I used some of the money to go on holiday for my birthday week. It was one of the greatest weeks of my life. I found a new flat. I did a digital marketing course and passed. I was \u201Cqualified\u201D now. 2017 felt like hell but in hindsight it was a positive year. 2018 wasn\u2019t. There were more rejections, doubts over my direction, work was eating away at me. I needed to get out but nobody wanted me. I moved departments and that helped but it wasn\u2019t enough. New year came, I stayed in. I didn\u2019t make any new year\u2019s resolutions. \u201CQue sera, sera\u201D as they say.</p>\n\n<p>And then another breakthrough.</p>\n\n<p>I was shopping in Wilko of all places and I got a call. It was a mobile number I didn\u2019t recognise and I assumed it was an agency. I\u2019d had a million calls from agencies amounting to nothing and hesitated. But I answered. A company were looking for a copywriter. It would involve writing about online gambling. The freelance project I worked on in 2017 was all about online gambling. This was great but I played it down. I made this my last chance. First interview went well, or as well as I think it could have. That\u2019s the problem with interviews \u2013 you can think it went okay and then you don\u2019t get it. They called me back for a second interview and asked me to complete a task. The second interview felt worse than the first. I panicked for the rest of the day thinking I\u2019d blown it. But I hadn\u2019t. I got the call to say I got the job. I didn\u2019t know what to say. The waiting and working had finally paid off.</p>\n\n<p>And then I realised something. Every move I\u2019d made, post I\u2019d written, people I\u2019d spoken to \u2013 they had all lead me here. It often feels like a clich\xE9 to say everything you do leads you to where you are but it\u2019s true. I felt pangs of regret that I hadn\u2019t pursued maths at college, at least with serious intent. I felt like my degree was a waste. But it lead me to this job. Had I not studied, I wouldn\u2019t have looked for the job at the label. I wouldn\u2019t have made music, wouldn\u2019t have started the blog, made friends with the guy who put me onto the freelance project that gave me the experience that helped me get the job. It all linked. I\u2019m reading this back and wondering if this is all too flowery; self-indulgent. Congratulations, you got a job, what\u2019s the big deal? Well, it is a big deal to me. I put myself down way too much. But now\u2019s the time to acknowledge my achievements. Why did I call this post \u201CEight\u201D? Because it took me 8 years to get to where I wanted to be. I joked to a colleague that I\u2019d made it out of Shawshank and that\u2019s how it felt. who I crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side (metaphorically of course). I finally had an answer to the question I couldn't answer. I\u2019ve been writing for Sampleface now for 7 years this year. It\u2019s not as popular as it used to be but I still write. Nothing will stop me writing bar a loss of upper extremities. I like to inform, to exhibit, and to teach. And it gets me where I need to go.</p>", "html": "<p>I wrote about this on Instagram but thought I\u2019d put it here too. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve written a blog post.
