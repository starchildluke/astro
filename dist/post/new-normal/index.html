      <h1>New normal</h1>
    <main>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/clvtno/status/1434670846241644545">@clvtno on Twitter wrote a good impromptu thread about the â€˜new normalâ€™ and the fallacy of the term</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>The phrase â€˜new normalâ€™ is one that grinds my gears in a very particular way, because look aroundâ€¦ nothing has fundamentally changed. Weâ€™ve had almost 2 years to review our processes and approach to literally everything and what do we have?
Same old, with a mask on.</p>
</blockquote><p>It echoed a lot of sentiments Iâ€™ve had in my head, rolling around like an unwanted red sock in a washing machine of white clothes. Something Iâ€™ve noticed about this â€˜new normalâ€™ (ðŸ¤¢) from a personal perspective is how my week has completely flipped. It used to consist of working amongst people Monday to Friday, doing the psuedo-extrovert stuff and coming home in the evening. Then Iâ€™d chill at the weekend on my jays doing mostly nothing. But now, itâ€™s almost the opposite. I now work from home (subject to slight change), Iâ€™m on my own and when Iâ€™m done I just close my laptop andâ€¦ leave the room. At weekends, however, at least in the last few weeks. Iâ€™ve been going out to different places and meeting up with people. I went to Birmingham a couple of weeks ago for teh first time in nearly 2 years, then went again with my son the week after, and this weekend I was at a family gathering. AND Iâ€™ve got a long overdue meet up with a friend to see Candyman at a real life cinema. I also plan to see my parents at some point next month and, if Iâ€™m lucky, go to Lisbon for my birthday (something I did in 2017 and 2018).</p><p>Iâ€™m not one of those YOLO types where Iâ€™m making up for lost time by engorging my soul into socialisation. Itâ€™s just that things have worked out this way. I still prefer my own company in my own house to relax and do nothing. But the role reversal has been strange and interesting. In some ways, I get a little bit more relaxed alone time by being at home to work for the week. I donâ€™t have to talk to people unless I make a video call. Iâ€™m still working but itâ€™s easier. Eventually, things will go back to something resembling what they were pre-pandemic and Iâ€™ll adjust again. I just hope itâ€™s not 7 days of socialising. I can only fake my extroversion for so long and I already have 2 years of unpacked pandemic anxiety, depression, and existential crises to sort out without adding a loss of identity to add to it (just kidding, I have that too!!!)</p><p>Anyway, the new normal can suck it and people whoâ€™ve learnt nothing and changed nothing during this current-and-still-happening pandemic can suck it too.</p><div class="tagged-as">Tagged as:</div><span class="tags">
