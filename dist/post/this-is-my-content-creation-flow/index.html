      <h1 class="title astro-Q4UD2W43">This is my content creation flow</h1>
    <main class="astro-Q4UD2W43">
      <p>A few months ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDavisSEO/status/1233102657826566144?s=20">I “revealed” my content creation flow</a> (as if it was a secret) and I said I’d write about it in more detail. So here it is.</p><h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2><p>For the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I’m prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.</p><p>The things I use are:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getpocket.com/en/">Pocket</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>/<a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
</ul><p>In terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress and Grav, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay £3/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I’ll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.</p><p>In total, it costs me about £140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.</p><h2 id="the-process">The process</h2><p>I run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can’t update everything as regularly as I’d like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:</p><ol>
<li>I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly</li>
<li>If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)</li>
<li>If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)</li>
<li>If I don’t want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard</li>
<li>I use a special Python script to decide what to write about</li>
<li>I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site</li>
<li>I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don’t write about it, I just put the link on there)</li>
</ol><h2 id="the-python-script">The Python script</h2><p>If you’re not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it’s purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!</p><p><a href="https://help.raindrop.io/collections/">Raindrop has its own API</a> which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my <a href="https://help.raindrop.io/collections">Collections</a>. Here’s the code:</p><pre class="astro-code" style="background-color: #0d1117; overflow-x: auto;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">import requests</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">import random</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">headers = {&#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE&#39;}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">r = requests.get(</span></span>

<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">raindrop_list = []</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">for num in range(0,len(response[&quot;items&quot;])):</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">	count = response[&quot;items&quot;][num][&quot;count&quot;]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">	title = response[&quot;items&quot;][num][&quot;title&quot;]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">	title_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">	raindrop_list.append(title_count)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">	raindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">rand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">print(raindrop[rand])</span></span></code></pre><p>I’ll explain each line.</p><p><code>requests</code> gives me access to the API and <code>random</code> is for the random pick, which I’ll explain in a second.</p><p>I set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.</p><p><code>raindrop_list</code> is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. <code>('Food &#x26; Drink', 7)</code>)</p><p>I create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called <code>count</code> and the title in <code>title</code>.</p><p><code>title_count</code> creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and <code>count</code>.</p><p>Each <code>title_count</code> gets added to <code>raindrop_list</code> and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called <code>raindrop</code> which gets rid of all the empty Collections.</p><p>Finally, I create a random integer between 0 and <code>len(raindrop_list)-1</code> and use that as the random index of <code>raindrop</code> which gets printed out.</p><p>Make sense? Probably not as that’s the first time I’ve ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don’t get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.</p><p>As for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This is a flow that works for me and I’m almost certain it won’t work for anyone else. That’s because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don’t have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!</p><p>But the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you’re done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just… stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I’m done.</p>
