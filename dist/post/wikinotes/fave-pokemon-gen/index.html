      <h1>My favourite Pokémon generations</h1>
    <section>
      
      <p>I thought I’d compile a list of my favourite Pokémon generations. This list will undoubtedly change over time as I play more of these games and as new games get released. Therefore, these positions won’t stick (except for the top 3; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOWAggYhgHQ">those are laminated</a>.)</p>
<p>Note: Games with an asterisk are ones I haven’t played or otherwise haven’t completed, which makes ranking them even harder!</p>
<h2 id="1-gen-ii">1. Gen II</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Gold/Silver/Crystal</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 9.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>: It built on everything I loved about Gen I and made it such an enjoyable gen. You got to go back to Kanto, which thrilled me as a kid. All the new Pokémon were cute and cool and interesting at the time (and arguably still are for the most part). Plus, we’ve since got some new variants and evolutions since then which have made them even cooler.</p>
<p>I also love Johto as a region. Game Freak really dug deep into the Japanese lore, which I appreciated. Yes, the level scaling after the Elite 4 wasn’t great and the fact that so many gym leaders didn’t use Gen II Pokémon was a poor decision but hey, you could still catch them and fight them elsewhere. And I’m sure people wouldn’t have complained <em>too</em> much if Clair didn’t have her Kingdra at the end.</p>
<p>If I had one significant gripe, it’d be that grinding is beyond frustrating—especially if you’re doing a Nuzlocke</p>
<h2 id="2-gen-i">2. Gen I</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Red/Green*/Blue/Yellow</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 9/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>: It’s the gen that started it all. I have some of the fondest memories of playing Blue as a kid and I always go back to it when I need an easy playthrough. A lot of my favourite Pokémon are from the first games and while the bugs and glitches aren’t ideal, they give the games a certain charm that were of their time. You can also give them exceptions due to the extreme working conditions that Game Freak made Gen 1 under (and that would continue into the present; looking at you, <a href="#6-gen-ix">Gen IX!</a>)</p>
<h2 id="3-gen-viii">3. Gen VIII</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Sword/Shield/Legends: Arceus*</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 8.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="4-gen-iv">4. Gen IV</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Diamond*/Pearl*/Platinum*/HeartGold/SoulSilver</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 8/10 (only for HGSS)</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="5-gen-ix">5. Gen IX</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Scarlet/Violet</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 7.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="6-gen-vi">6. Gen VI</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: X*/Y*/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="7-gen-v">7. Gen V</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Black/White/Black 2/White 2</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 6.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>: This used to be at the bottom of the list because I really didn’t enjoy Black and White. However, Game Freak did the thing with Black 2/White 2. It felt like a modern JRPG and they went hard with the dragon-mech-dystopia lore in a way I didn’t expect. The cutscenes aren’t too invasive and the bits with the frigate and the Kyurem vs Reshiram/Zekrom are spectactular. That said, I still don’t like BW so that’s why it’s down here.</p>
<h2 id="8-gen-iii">8. Gen III</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald*/FireRed/LeafGreen</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 6/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="9-gen-vii">9. Gen VII</h2>
<p><strong>Games</strong>: Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 5/10</p>
<p><strong>Why I love it</strong>: Placing this at the bottom seems harsh but it’s just that all the other gens appealed to me more. SM/USUM suffered greatly from a bloated storyline with way too many cut scenes that stilted my enjoyment of the games. There were plenty of good Pokémon but the poor gameplay outweighed them.</p>
