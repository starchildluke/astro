      <h1>Morsel #4 - bulk upload to Internet Archive with waybackpy and advertools</h1>

</ul><p>Credit to <a href="https://www.holisticseo.digital/python-seo/internet-archive/">Koray Tuğberk GÜBÜR</a> for the code and the idea.</p><p>I only made a slight variation, using advertools to pull pages from a sitemap and <code>to_list()</code> over <code>apply()</code> and a <code>lambda</code> function when extracting URLs to iterate over. Purely a preference thing.</p><p>Also shout out to <a href="https://github.com/eliasdabbas/advertools">Elias Dabbas for the advertools library</a> which has made sitemap handling in Python so much easier.</p>
