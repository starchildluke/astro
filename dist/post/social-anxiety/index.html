      <h1>Social anxiety</h1>
    <main>
      <p>By the end of 2019, I was in the best place I’d been in years. I was finally in the career I’d fought to get into for the past 8 years, money was alright, I had a partner and I was happy. And then <a href="/wiki/covid-19/">2020 did its thing</a> and ran through my life like a wrecking ball. But of all the things that the last couple of years have ruined that upsets me the most, it’s the work on my social anxiety.</p><p>When I was a child, I was very outgoing and had little inhibitions. Confidence was sky high (to the point of arrogance sometimes but being precocious is part of childhood, right?) Then high school changed that. I had friendship group but I always felt… different or “outside”. I was picked on quite a lot in my final year and made a very stupid decision a few years before that for me excluded for a week (I won’t discuss that here). College was my attempt to shrug off my academic prowess for a taste of pseudo-extroversion and it kinda worked for a couple of years, and into uni but then I developed depression. And dropped out.</p><p>Anyway, skip 14 years and in that time, I realised a few things:</p><ul>
<li>That “outsider” feeling was probably the fact that I was neurodivergent without knowing what the hell that was (recently, I took a few online tests that suggested I had “severe” symptoms for autism and while I won’t go into that in this post, that makes more sense to me than anything in the last few years - although I’m not sure about the word “severe” but I digress)</li>
<li>I was an introvert and still am (I didn’t discover that until 2012)</li>
<li>I wasn’t comfortable with who I was and desperately tried to be someone else until the pretence became so exhausting I couldn’t keep it up</li>
</ul><p>And only now do I have the self confidence I needed all those years ago. But it feels like it’s come at a cost. I feel more isolated than ever. I don’t feel like I fit in with anyone bar a small group of mostly online friends. Everything about socialising makes me feel uncomfortable, anxious, and skeptical. What do people want from me when I talk to them? Do I need to say lots? Have they judged me already and want me to leave? Do they think I’m weird? Do I make too many weird references? Am I annoying? Do people hate me? Maybe my self confidence isn’t in a good place.</p><p>Except it kinda is. I know I’m good at what I do, professionally or with my hobbies. I love the music I make, I’m a very good SEO, and I’m funny. But that doesn’t “get me in” with people, so to speak. Have you ever played <a href="https://www.subbuteo.com/">Subbuteo</a>? There’s a special contraption you use for a player that takes set pieces and that’s all they do. Or perhaps you know the NFL and special teams? Well, I feel like a kicker. I’m called on for a niche requirement and then… nothing. That’s how I feel, even if it’s not true. But I’d never know if it was real or not because how do you ask for confirmation without sound weird or expecting to get a straight honest answer. And so I live in doubt that anyone I speak to thinks I’m an interesting well-rounded person. I know <em>some</em> people do because they’ve told me and I feel comfortable being myself around them. Others vary. But the important thing is I try hard not to diminish myself (too much). I mean, I hold back my idiosyncrasies when I fear they’ll be weaponised against me based on prior evidence. But otherwise I’m me. And it’s taken years to accept who I was, which is still a work in progress, in spite of growing social anxiety and fear of what someone will say or do because of it.</p><p>I’ve not had anyone “call me out” yet and I’ll keep toeing that anxiety line like a nervous trapeze artist over a precarious safety net they sewed themselves.</p><div class="tagged-as">Tagged as:</div><span class="tags"><a href="/about/">me</a> </span>
