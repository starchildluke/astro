    <main class="astro-Y2KPJA2R">
      <p>I’ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they’ve changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I’ve decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn’t sure whether to do it as it’s very niche to me but I’ve taken a step out of my comfort zone.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/lukedavisseo/ralts">GitHub link to RALTS repository</a></p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2><ol>

</ol><h2 id="ralts"> What is RALTS?</h2><p>RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it’s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I’ll explain those all in more detail later.</p><p>There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I’ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema">https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow">https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow</a></li>

<li><a href="https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs">https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs</a></li>
</ul><p>In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I’m a Pokémon fan. It’s a backronym but it works for me.</p><h2 id="why_did_you_make_this">Why did I make it?</h2><p>tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.</p><p>I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I’m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).</p><p>Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn’t think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.</p><h2 id="notes_on_my_coding">Notes on my coding</h2><p>Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I’ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I’ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven’t finished. You’ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for “stupid code” and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).</p><p>I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his <a href="https://github.com/joeddav/zero-shot-demo">zero shot demo</a>. He wrote a great piece on <a href="https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html">zero shot learning</a> which you should read if you’re interested.</p><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/zero-shot/">There’s also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action</a>.</p><p>If I’ve taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I’ve forgotten to credit or if you’d prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.</p><h2 id="some_definitions">Some definitions</h2><p>So, about that original explanation. Let’s look at some definitions:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has “an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Categories - The term “categories” is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment &gt; animation; health &gt; hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance &gt; media &gt; advertising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They’re basically like tags.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="tech_requirements">Tech requirements</h2><p>These are the following Python packages used in the script:</p><pre class="language-null"><code data-astro-raw="" class="language-null">streamlit&gt;=1.0.0

I have also set a cache so it doesn’t reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.</p><p>The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.</p><p>The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.</p><p>The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604">thanks to Jess for the help with that</a>) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.</p><p>The fifth and final function brings everything together.

To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags’ counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.</p><p>Finally, they’re all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.</p><h3 id="8-the-entity-topic-and-category-functions-using-the-textrazor-api">8.

I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it’ll give me a 1 or 0 if not.

I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow (<a href="/post/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/">also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago</a>).</p><p>But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:</p><ul>
<li>To analyse text for entity relevance</li>
<li>To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)</li>
<li>Content ideas</li>
<li>To check if your text is aligned how you want it</li>
</ul><h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2><p>This Python script is not perfect. It’s rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.</p><p>One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn’t fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.</p><p>There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I’ve been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don’t like to say “hey, I made this thing” because who cares (that’s what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.</p>
