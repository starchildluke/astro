&lt;p&gt;But before I go into that, let me take you back to the early 00s. The year 2000 to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was living in Atlanta at the time as my dad had got a teaching job out there. While we only lasted 6 months out there, it was the start of my obsession with the Web. My mum worked at my school library a few times a week and every Wednesday, I&apos;d stay after school for a couple of hours and spend my time in the library. Amongst the shelves of books were a few rows of computers and I&apos;d basically fall down Web-bit holes, exploring everything the Internet had to offer. When we moved back to the UK, I got myself a Yahoo! email address and consolidated my preferences for their search engine over Google (even Ask Jeeves took precedence!). I also discovered that you could make your own website, thrusting me into the world of web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all about Tripod and Homestead for Web hosting, Geocities, FrontPage Express (the free version of Microsoft Frontpage), and lots of HTML. I&apos;d use my dad&apos;s work laptop to code my site after spending 20 minutes plucking up the courage to ask. I never finished a site but it was so fun that I didn&apos;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I matured and moved onto Dreamweaver, more sustainable Web hosting, and then a myriad of different frameworks and environments. It was mostly HTML and, now, CSS. Building stuff from scratch. There was no &quot;responsiveness&quot; back then. I avoided Flash like the plague but thought &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing_(interface_design)&quot;&gt;slicing&lt;/a&gt;&quot; was the most amazing thing that I just couldn&apos;t pull off. And absolutely no JavaScript, yuck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My start as an Astro-naut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2021 and by then, I was on the tenth iteration of my personal site and I&apos;d started working for my current employer as an SEO Executive. I was using Grav at the time and enjoying it, although I didn&apos;t get on with its templating language, Twig (with hindsight, I get it now). I&apos;d even tried Jekyll for a bit when I got obsessed with the idea of linkblogs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meowni.ca/&quot;&gt;Monica Dinculescu&apos;s website&lt;/a&gt; (which remains a stylistic inspiration for this one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found Astro, this new framework that promised &amp;lt;q cite=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/&quot;&amp;gt;faster websites with less client-side Javascript&amp;lt;/q&amp;gt;. I&apos;d just started getting into Web performance so this piqued my interest. I was comfortable enough Terminal and running builds to get behind how Astro worked. So I took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemme tell ya: those first few months were &amp;lt;span style=&quot;color:#fc1420;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent hours and hours trying to get things working. The truth was, while there was less client-side JavaScript—with it being a static site generator—there was MORE JavaScript in the backend for me. I&apos;d been used to hard-coding everything but Astro gave me the opportunity to create stuff dynamically. Go to my homepage and you&apos;ll see a little greeting in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. That&apos;s static now but in the pre-build code, it&apos;s JavaScript. At least that was simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Persistence paid off... until it didn&apos;t... and then it did again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those nights troubleshooting until 3am paid off in the end. I&apos;d joined the Discord, became engaged, asked for help, and got what I needed to that point. But with more updates came new features. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/&quot;&gt;Content Collections&lt;/a&gt; were introduced with Astro 2.0. These allowed for better management of content in an Astro project if you had, say, a blog or newsletter, or wanted to consolidate authors. The problem was that I&apos;d set everything up without this and the thought of refactoring everything gave me a headache, so I abstained for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of lagging behind didn&apos;t sit well with me though and I rolled up my proverbial sleeves and gave it a go. Thanks to the documentation and not caring much about the URL changes (post &amp;gt; posts, oh no what would Google do???), I pulled through and have since built the collections out with more sections. Easy peasy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...no really. That was it. My woes were over (well, apart from reducing some of the bloat from my node modules folder which briefly broke everything but it all got fixed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have one more dragon to slay though: JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in technical SEO means exposure to JavaScript, either directly through JavaScript SEO or realising that web devs use it way too much and... let me not digress. I&apos;d tried learning multiple times in the past and couldn&apos;t get my head around it all. It all felt too much like C++ which I&apos;d tried and failed with during the computer science degree I dropped out of in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you&apos;ve got this far, you&apos;ll know I don&apos;t let something get me down for too long when it comes to learning. I started up my web development course again on Udemy and went through everything from the beginning. I was well versed in Python already so most of the basics were the same but I didn&apos;t want to skip over anything. Eventually, I got the hang of the easy stuff and got to grips with event handlers (love those things), figured out what maps did after using them without prior knowledge. Everything was clicking and I had Astro to thank for setting me on the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Would I recommend Astro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell yeah I would. There are a ton of Web frameworks out there (I think it should be called JAMStack&lt;strong&gt;ed&lt;/strong&gt; to be honest) and they all come with their own pros and cons but Astro caught my eye &lt;s&gt;first&lt;/s&gt; second for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The community is super helpful and friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use as little or as much JavaScript as you want but HTML and CSS are the foundations: it&apos;s all about progressive enhancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the major frameworks integrate with Astro really well, and you can extend it with a variety of CMS&apos;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s constantly evolving but in a way that enriches rather than alienates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The syntax will be familiar to people who have used other frameworks before and relatively easy to pick up if you haven&apos;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They really care about web performance, so sites are super fast out of the box (and I&apos;m obliged to say this is good for SEO BUT &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf/&quot;&gt;only as a small factor as I&apos;ve written about before&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They helped me overcome my fear of JavaScript and use it strategically to embellish what I already had, rather than replace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to join in and build a better Web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://astro.build/&quot;&gt;head to the Astro website and get started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, that sounds about right.</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you embrace a person, it indicates a sense of love, warmth, comfort, and trust. Now imagine associating those feelings with AI. And then for SEO. It starts sounding weird and inadvisable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&apos;s exactly the kind of rhetoric I see on social media. The idea is that because AI is &quot;here to stay&quot; and it&apos;s all interesting and exciting and kinda problematic but we can ignore that because of the interest and excitement that we need to coddle this technology else we fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I disagree. I think adoption of AI tech is completely optional, even if Google is going ahead with things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//search/howsearchworks/google-about-SGE.pdf&quot;&gt;Search Generative Experience (SGE)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[PDF]&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. I keep seeing SEOs clambering to test it out in its flawed infancy and trying to gain knowledge that isn&apos;t there (and I&apos;m not even referring to the AI itself!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means satiate your curiosity but don&apos;t assume any findings are immediately significant because Google holds all the cards and can change the rules at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a lot of (boring) debate about AI&apos;s effectiveness as a tooling technology. I&apos;ve written a few bits about it &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/&quot;&gt;being a starting point&lt;/a&gt; and something you should use &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/ai-should-be-a-last-resort/&quot;&gt;as a last resort&lt;/a&gt;. None of those things require you to &quot;embrace&quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be focusing less on tech that we don&apos;t know a lot about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-climate-impact-goes-beyond-its-emissions/&quot;&gt;that has environmental issues&lt;/a&gt;, that&apos;s basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2024/04/03/amazons-ai-powered-just-walk-outcheckout-option-turns-out-to-be-1000-workers-watching-you-shop.html&quot;&gt;underpaid people of colour sat on each other&apos;s shoulders in a giant trenchcoat&lt;/a&gt;, and more on the things that matter and are more proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be managing expectations and making things happen ourselves. Coddling a probabilistic bag of words without critical thought won&apos;t get us there.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Some brief thoughts on robots.txt</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-brief-thoughts-on-robots-txt/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-brief-thoughts-on-robots-txt/</guid><description>I wrote some thoughts about robots.txt and how you should use it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;(I started writing this at around 10:30pm so it&apos;s kinda rough and from memory. I&apos;ll likely update this with examples and more specific information and explanations over time. This is more of a guide than verbatim instructions so take it as you will and always test things with your own site to be sure.)&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of technical SEO is muscle memory. You can automate a lot of things but because no two sites are ever truly the same, you, the SEO, need to pick out what really matters and what doesn&apos;t. For me, it&apos;s better if a human does it compared to a catch-all solution or a machine learning tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I&apos;ve grown accustomed to is assessing the use and unintentional misuse of robots.txt. If you don&apos;t know, robots.txt is a text file that contains instructions that a search engine bot should follow when crawling a site. The most common directives relate to what pages a crawler can and can&apos;t crawl, using the keywords &lt;code&gt;allow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;disallow&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what mine looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;User-agent: *
Allow: /

User-Agent: ChatGPT-User
Disallow: /

User-Agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /

Sitemap: https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/sitemap.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This says that any crawler can crawl the site... except ChatGPT-User, GPTBot, and Google-Extended (which are all AI crawlers, although given their current practices for scraping, these might be redundant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On e-commerce sites, you&apos;ll see a lot of URL path types blocked from crawls such as search pages (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;example.org/search/blah+blah+blah&lt;/strong&gt;) and filter parameter pages (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;example.org/?filter=colour&amp;amp;size=large&lt;/strong&gt;). But, for Google, this isn&apos;t always the best way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro&quot;&gt;In their documentation on robots.txt&lt;/a&gt;, they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s arguably the most important point of the documentation. Robots.txt is there to stop your servers from getting overloaded by crawl requests through carefully selected directives. That&apos;s where the efficiency lies. But blocking pages from being crawled won&apos;t block it from getting into the index, and a lot of sites (often by default) have directives that disallow common page types as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Googlebot often follows this correctly and they will get blocked and therefore won&apos;t get indexed but it&apos;s not guaranteed to stay that way, especially if you happen to link to those blocked pages anywhere else, and in abundance. I&apos;ve come across sites that link to blocked filter pages &lt;em&gt;at scale&lt;/em&gt; and since links are heavily weighted Google&apos;s search algorithms, they see this as a strong signal for indexation. The result: blocked pages get indexed. This isn&apos;t inherently a bad thing for search as these pages aren&apos;t optimised and won&apos;t take up much if any visiblity for a site for important keywords... but they could, and if you&apos;ve used a technique for one thing, you don&apos;t want it to be ignored or mess up your overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do in these situations? Drum roll please...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🥁 🥁 🥁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...IT DEPENDS! 🎉 🍾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, as Google said, if you don&apos;t want a page to be indexed, use noindex. Robots.txt wasn&apos;t designed for noindexation so don&apos;t use it for that. The reason why so many frameworks and platforms block certain page types like search and filters is often sites have thousands of pages and you&apos;ll want a crawler to focus on product and category pages over things like in-site search. In fact, these pages are often canonicalised or noindexed anyway in which case blocking them via robots.txt could actually be a problem anyway (it might not see the noindex or canonical if it&apos;s blocked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to stop Googlebot from pressuring your servers with crawl requests (based on evidence that Googlebot is doing this in the first place), add a disallow directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a smaller site* and just don&apos;t want pages to be indexed, add a noindex tag and don&apos;t sweat the technique. I mean, crawling of those pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawl effiency isn&apos;t a concern for a small site as Googlebot can handle this without issue. Problems may arise if your site dynamically generates more pages that a crawler can find and that&apos;s when you need to address the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;By smaller, I mean &amp;lt;100,000 pages as the roughest of rough estimates, YMMV, please test this as there are no hard and fast rules in this game!&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 7 things I&apos;ve picked up over that period.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the fifth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (you can &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/first-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;read about my first year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/second-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;second year&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/third-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/fourth-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;fourth year&lt;/a&gt; to follow my journey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been an amazing journey so far and I like to share what I&apos;ve learnt every year so here are some of my lessons from my fifth year as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. John Mueller still remains the MVP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, if you&apos;re reading this, thank you for your patience, hard work, and technical support. Same as last year. And the years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science have waxed and waned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I said that AI, web performance, and graph science had &quot;enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined&quot; and while that&apos;s still true, they haven&apos;t all continued on an upward trajectory. I did an AI webinar last year and released a tool (which is effectively a OpenAI wrapper with some Python automation, built primarily for entry-level use) but my personal feelings have decreased as AI tech is used as an excuse to put people out of work and retain profits for capitalists. Now, I use generative AI sparingly and general NLP a bit more. Web performance still remains a passion although I still don&apos;t like how it&apos;s used as a beacon for ranking improvements when its focus should be on revenue and session quality attribution. And I haven&apos;t touched graph science for a long time. neo4j still isn&apos;t functional on M1 or M2 Mac chips and that&apos;s the only way I used it. I don&apos;t have the energy to find alternatives and learn a whole new UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Python still rocks and I&apos;m learning JavaScript (again)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m building more tools in Python and it feels good. I&apos;m also trying to learn JavaScript again because it matters for my work more than ever and I&apos;ve been putting it off for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. I still love web performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still doing lots of Core Web Vitals audits but now pushing back (in my head) on them for sites where site speed isn&apos;t a priority. If a site is small, CWV scores won&apos;t do anything for ranking and there are always bigger priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I still say that synthetic data is important and we can build a more inclusive Web for everyone if we care enough and put in the work (sadly, I&apos;ve not found a way to show this in a work capacity that DOESN&apos;T involve a business case)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Seriously, stop using (generative) AI for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLP, embeddings, vector search, clustering, fuzzy matching, all that kind of stuff? Good. It&apos;s under the AI umbrella and I think they are good use cases when done properly. But most of that isn&apos;t sexy so we&apos;re stuck with generative AI as the poster boy and a lot of it sucks. I&apos;ve written that generative AI works well as a creative kickstarter but that&apos;s not how it&apos;s sold or how most people use it. Everyone complains about search results pages being filled with AI garbage written for the sake of SEO and The Verge are taking the lead on calling SEO out for a lot of the blame (with varying success, I won&apos;t go into it here because it bores and annoys me). We could just not use it so much and take care in how we use it. But experts couldn&apos;t pretend to know-it-all and sell us all snake oil and apparently, that&apos;s worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5a. I find generative AI really boring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve used generative AI a fair bit in the last few years but I apply some critical thinking to what I do because a lot of it isn&apos;t tested thoroughly and it&apos;s not scaled for mass use (tl;dr - it&apos;s not really at an adequate production level). The problem is, I see a lot of use cases that are promoted as &quot;something for everything&quot; but without any indication of methodology or testing. And everyone seems to be okay with it because they say &quot;ooh, interesting!&quot; And I honestly find this repetitive cycle boring. Generative AI may produce coherent sentences but they&apos;re soulless and even if you get a human to juj it up, why not just get the human to write it. Now, I&apos;ve mentioned that &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/&quot;&gt;generative AI is good as a kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and I stand by that. But so many people are trying to hoodwink us, pretending that things have been checked when they haven&apos;t. We already have soulless, stale content written by humans—generative AI models only speed that process up and that&apos;s not innovation for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. I don&apos;t want to see your keyword/traffic graphs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In or out of context, all these Google Search Console and Ahrefs graphs mean nothing. And even with added information on how you scaled 100s of pages with templated text, you just look bad and that traffic will go the opposite way and you&apos;ll blame Google rather than yourself. If you start a website with no content and then start adding indexable content, your lines will eventually go up. It&apos;s not magic, it&apos;s not strategy, it&apos;s just how search engines work. Please stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. We all need to get our priorities straight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving the best til last. I&apos;ve had to learn that a lot of what we&apos;re asked to do or think we need to do isn&apos;t that important in the grander scheme of things. Site speed for most small sites isn&apos;t a priority compared to &quot;helpful content&quot; (unless the site is so slow that it&apos;s unusable and this often isn&apos;t the case, at least in my experience). Meta descriptions? Not a priority compared to literally anything. Bold keywords, keyword density, word count, &quot;LSI keywords&quot;, keywords in headings, all things that should never be looked at or made priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And beyond the technicalities of our work, we also need to get it together from a moral and human perspective. Who are we working with and what do we stand for? I wrote about being &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/&quot;&gt;Black in digital marketing last year&lt;/a&gt; and it was sad to see so many of those micro and macroaggressions still prevalent 3 years later. D&amp;amp;I is getting cut heavily in the tech industry and what is left isn&apos;t working for everyone. I get that these things are a work in progress but the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; isn&apos;t the thing to applaud and feel good about. And we shouldn&apos;t need data to justify actions—we should just be doing the actions, which goes beyond D&amp;amp;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that people think SEO is spammy crap. Whether that&apos;s true or not might not the thing to focus on. What these figure heads should be doing is demystifying a lot of our practices, not couch everything in vague language as to obscure what&apos;s really happening, and stop walling free information. There are plenty of things Google could do but profit and notoriety comes first. That doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t keep fighting them on their crap practices but we should also keep our expectations in check. We won&apos;t find out what all the algorithms and factors are. Even these reports claiming they know what they are (looking at you, Backlinko) aren&apos;t that helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once said that I liked SEO academically but disliked the industry. That still rings true today and there&apos;s still time to change that, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shout outs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to anyone I&apos;ve spoken to personally in the last year or have shouted out publically or in a work setting (you&apos;ll know who you are). I&apos;ve decided not to list people this time as not to forget anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People keep saying &quot;someone needs to build a search engine that gives you what you&apos;re looking for&quot; and forget/don&apos;t know that to get the best results, you&apos;d need an index and crawlers as good as Google&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be trade-offs no matter which way you look and as soon as you bring AI into the mix, you&apos;re basically doing what Google does (but &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; with arguably different motives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also worth noting that Google has been using AI in search for a very long time—it&apos;s just not been generative until recently. And AI isn&apos;t the root of the problem here—greed and profit above anything is, which is why we have all these layoffs, as opposed to &quot;AI taking your job&quot; (which it isn&apos;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we also underestimate the size of the Web we&apos;re wanting to crawl, index, and return results for. Common Crawl, the data archive used by most popular large language models, is only a portion of the Web, and not a very big one despite its proliferation in use. But people treat it as if it&apos;s &quot;the Web&quot; or a very good representation of it, enough to use it via chatbots and AI software &lt;em&gt;as a search engine&lt;/em&gt;. Big mistake. That false use case is part of why we get so much misinformation from it, which is unfortunately finding itself onto actual search engines in the form of terrible AI-generated articles for the sake of SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s taken Google decades to get to this level of power. You&apos;re not going to get anyone to build bigger and better any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

That&apos;s what a linkblog is all about.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a digital magpie, and I have been for a while. I&apos;ll see a cool thing and I&apos;ll want it to the point of hyperfocusing. Well, the latest thing that has caught my eye is a linkblog (or linklog as it is sometimes known as). Here&apos;s the Wikipedia definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linklog is a type of blog which is meant to act as a linked list. Common practice is for the post titles to link directly to an external URLs, and the content of the post includes information to complement the associated URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to this form of blogging was with Kottke.org and his Quick Links (previously, he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/15/01/the-return-of-the-remaindered-links-sort-of&quot;&gt;Remaindered Links&lt;/a&gt; which inspired other people&apos;s linkblogs when they were popular in the 2000s and 2010s.) They&apos;re basically a sentence or two with some hyperlinked text. Easy. I&apos;ve since incorporated my own version of Quick Links on my other blogs and called them Cool Links but they&apos;re actually closer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2004/05/asides/&quot;&gt;asides&lt;/a&gt;, which is something a bit different but in the same ballpark. The difference is tha tmy Cool Links are actually regular posts with a title and body text but on my blog homepage, they just appear as body text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you mean I&apos;ve lost you and that I should get to the point???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, linkblogs! I wanted one because I don&apos;t always feel comfortable just throwing a Cool Link on my blogs and that taking up the main feed. I looked through a variety of examples for inspiration and realised there were so many that I was getting choice paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I calmed myself down, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meiert.com/en/blog/the-problem-with-link-blogs-plus-five-link-blogs-that-rock/&quot;&gt;ignored a naysayer I found&lt;/a&gt;, and created an ongoing linkblog right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/linkblog/&quot;&gt;https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/linkblog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&apos;m not using a CMS, the process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find a link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a custom-made Streamlit web app to add it to a JSON file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The linkblog page reads the JSON file and display the content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I toyed with the idea of a SQL database but it seemed like overkill. Maybe I&apos;ll revisit if I find the JSON file too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to anyone thinking about doing the same, just go and do it. It&apos;s your space on the Web, who cares what anyone else thinks? Just don&apos;t let large language models write the stuff for you.&lt;/p&gt;

So here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote an article called &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/2017-needs-brevity-nuance/&quot;&gt;2017 Needs Brevity And Nuance&lt;/a&gt; 7 years ago and while I still think we need both, I want something else in 2024—and mainly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 has shown me how impatient we can all be and I&apos;ve definitely felt that thrown in my direction this year. It has caused me stress, anxiety, and exhausted me beyond belief. Sometimes, it was an urgent need for my time or expertise where panic was unwarranted. Or where I struggled with something and needed someone to be patient with me, but got the opposite. With my &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/probably-autistic/&quot;&gt;ongoing journey through autism&lt;/a&gt; and neurodivergence as a whole, I&apos;ve noticed things I do that people can find difficult to deal with: mainly how I communicate and my issues with decisiveness. I&apos;m not trying to be weird or make things hard for people; my brain just gets in the way of the best or simplest solution. But while I navigate that, I need people to give me time and space to get there rather than feel like I&apos;m an inconvenience, being weird, or acting like a child. In hindsight, my neurodivergence has been around for decades and I&apos;ve had to learn how neurotypical people act and respond accordingly. So I&apos;m not a weird kid—I&apos;m an adult who just needs some patience to get to where we all want to go. It&apos;s the least I deserve, especially when I actively give that time and space to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s where the need for assertiveness comes in. I went to my first CBT sessions back in 2017 (it was a pivotal year, evidently!) and assertiveness was something that cropped up a lot as something I needed. Elements of it have improved, particularly in work, but I could still do a lot better. In fact, I&apos;ve arguably &lt;em&gt;regressed&lt;/em&gt; in certain areas of my life; backing down rather than saying something. I say it&apos;s to conserve energy and while that&apos;s true, there may have been times where I could have dealt with issues better if I&apos;d been assertive rather than passive (or aggressive, another annoying go-to of mine). It&apos;s easier said than done but setting boundaries, being firm in them, and not backing down—even if there are uncomfortable conversations and reactions involved—is ultimately for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I know people see me in a certain way and I have no intention of changing the things that they see. But knowing people treat me differently because of them, in a way I can see and feel, makes me sad. It&apos;s not about wanting to be normal or &quot;not me&quot; (been there, done that), it&apos;s about a wish for patience from others and for people to maybe stop and think about how they act and the impacts those actions have. Wherever we are on the everchanging planes of neurodivergence, we could also use a bit of care and time to ponder and reflect and make life a bit easier to deal with. I want that for me and if that can&apos;t be the default, I&apos;ll firmly prod you with my assertiveness rod until I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no worries if not, let me know xxx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey has become a pilgrimage of sorts. But the experience is more spiritual than religious and for the second time, I got to share it with my partner, Shelley, who loves the city almost as much as me. So this is how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday - Sábado&lt;/h2&gt;

&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;They really are pizza wizards!&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flight was at 7:30am at London-Luton Airport. We&apos;d driven down the night before and stayed at a nearby hotel. We even had time to get some dinner in Luton town centre, which I&apos;d not visited in about 6 years (much had changed and much had stayed the same). The flight out was delayed by over an hour due to fog but it went smoothly once we were up in the air. The journey from the airport to my hotel was as smooth as it had ever been the other 3 times I&apos;d done it. I still marveled at having 4G underground. We stayed at the same hotel as before: Lisbon City Hotel. Our room was smaller than last time but big enough for what we needed: somewhere to chill and sleep. And we got a balcony which my partner took full advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we got there early afternoon, we managed to have lunch at a place we&apos;d visited the year before called Tapas n&apos; Friends. The food was delicious and I practically inhaled everything, along with an espresso martini! When in Lisbon and all that. We then went shopping in Baixa-Chiado and I got a zipped jumper and some records. It&apos;d been years since I&apos;d gone crate digging so I relished the opportunity. The two LPs I got were Clues and Riptide by Robert Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, we hit a spot we visited last year called Pizza Wizard. My partner was eager to go back as was I and the pizzas did not disappoint. Great crusts, great dough, great toppings. I only had a few slices as I wasn&apos;t super hungry but it was enough and we left satisfied. &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;Obrigado&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, Pizza Wizard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday - Domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/crispy-mafya-burger.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;a chicken burger on a plate, covered in shredded cheese&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque!&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first full day. We had breakfast, the classic continental breakfast with our favourite panpipe music playing on the speakers; it&apos;s become our thing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/&quot;&gt;Museu Calouste Gulbenkian&lt;/a&gt; after missing it last year. Because they were redecorating the modernist section, we explored the main building which housed classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. The grounds are an homage to early 20th century modernism and Brutalism with its extensive use of concrete. My partner walked around and pointed out the various plants and we discovered one we&apos;d never heard of before (the West Indian Lantana
). We also had a drink and some &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;pastéis de nata&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; at the main café before we explored the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time to kill, we took the Metro down to the coast and walked across to Cais do Sodre but before we did, we stopped off at a restaurant called Bel Forno. Great pizza and even better sangria that my partner enjoyed. Afterwards, we reached the Praça do Comércio and enjoyed the space and the sculptures around us before we stopped to watch a street performance (I will add their names once I find them!) It was very entertaining!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was over, we made our way back to our hotel to rest before one final trip out for dinner to a place called Crispy Mafya. It&apos;s a fried chicken restaurant and, unlike last year, I was ready to have a proper meal. I had a &quot;New York Burger&quot; and it tasted so good. The ambience was super chill, even with occupied tables, and the music was perfect with a heavy slant on UK hip hop, grime, and drill (Giggs was on maybe three times? You love to see it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very cultured day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday - Segunda-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday started with a trip to Belém and an attempt to visit the Jerónimos Monastery. However, despite Google claiming it was open all day on Mondays... it wasn&apos;t (I&apos;ve sent them proof so hopefully they change it so others don&apos;t make the same mistake). We took some photos and walked across to the Centro Cultural de Belém to see what happened to the old Museu Coleção Berardo (now called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccb.pt/en/macccb/&quot;&gt;MAC-CCB&lt;/a&gt;). However, it was also closed on Mondays which I didn&apos;t realise until writing this just now 🤦🏽‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a long-ish walk across the main road to a little café/restaurant by the River Tagus (Rio Tejo) so we could eat and I could pee (lol). We both had a burger and chips with a ginger ale. Living the dream! The main reason for crossing over to the riverside was to visit MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology) and it had some new features since we visited last year. The biggest change was the renaming of the three sections of the museum, now called MAAT Garden, MAAT Central, and MAAT Gallery. MAAT Gallery had some new exhibits with art from Joana Vasconcelos, Mário Cesariny, and pieces from the Carmona e Costa Foundation Collection, Portugal&apos;s largest private collection. I really enjoyed the various art and my partner ADORED it, especially the textiles from Joana Vasconcelos&apos;s exhibit. I loved seeing her eyes light up 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/valkyrie-octopus.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;a tentacular textile sculpture called Valkyrie Octopus&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Tentacular and spectacular!&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we went to our favourite restaurant: Atalho do Cais. For me, it has quintessential Portuguese/Brazilian vibes in terms of ambience and decor. But the food hails from different lands, serving a mix of Iberian meats and Japanese sushi dishes. The star of the show was the wagyu beef carpaccio that my partner might have loved more than me by the sounds of things 😂 but again, I was happy to see her so happy and enjoying the food and the atmosphere like I was. I had some fancy garlic bread, another burger, and a chocolate cake for pudding. I even had space for wedges and I&apos;m sure everything was sprinkled with crack because it was all so moreish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday - Terça-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/sporting-cp-shirts.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;three Sporting CP shirts &quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Vamos, Sporting!&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the day I revisited Estádio José Alvalade, Sporting CP&apos;s home stadium. It was the first time I&apos;d been back since 2017 much to the faux-disdain of my partner who &quot;supports&quot; Benfica, a decision heavily influenced by their star striker, Gonçalo Ramos. The stadium also has the Alvaláxia shopping centre attached to it so we walked through there (I&apos;d done the same before the match I went to in 2017) and then walked around the outside until we reached the team shop. I spent a long time browsing for things to get and in the end, my partner bought me a new shirt and a tracktop as an early birthday present and I got a notebook and pin for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, we wanted to go back to Pizza Wizard but they weren&apos;t open, sadly. But their loss was another restaurant&apos;s gain as we had dinner at Anarchia. Again, gorgeous decor and delicious food. I wanted all their cutlery and crockery! Afterwards, we ambled back to the hotel, which wasn&apos;t far from the restaurant, and waited for 12:00am to clock over so I could usher in another year of my birth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday - Quarta-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/partner-oceanario-de-lisbon.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;my partner looking at the sharks and fish at the Oceanário de Lisboa&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Beauty in nature&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sixth birthday spent abroad, my fourth in Lisbon, and my second with my partner - but what to do? Well, after midnight, I opened one of my presents which was a Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp;amp; Violet Elite Trainer Box and I opened a couple of packs (one had a pull!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some much needed sleep, we had breakfast and got ready for the day ahead. We&apos;d planned to go to the Oceanário de Lisboa again as we went last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. But i also wanted to visit the nearby Vasco do Gama shopping centre before heading down to our birthday dinner spot called Las Ficheras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oceanário de Lisboa was amazing, as expected. We traversed the different biomes, full of marine life both flora and fauna, before heading to the café for lunch. I had a pasta salad and apple crumble for dessert. Eating the crumble was excavating a fossil site it was so hard, but tasty nonetheless. We took a trip over the river via cable car and eventually found our way to the shopping centre. I got a few goodies from Fnac before heading back to the hotel to rest and making it back out to Las Ficheras for dinner. I had a quesadilla for main and a chocolate &quot;mousse&quot; for dessert (it wasn&apos;t as airy as expected but it was still sweet and tasty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best birthdays I&apos;ve had in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday - Quinta-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/cow-santa-outfit.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;a cow dressed in a santa outfit&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Boo? More like mooo!&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last day in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our flight was in the evening, we had some time to kill so we headed to El Corte Inglés to get some Christmas tree decorations and have lunch nearby. I was sad to leave but it&apos;s become a ritual to start the festivities after my birthday and that cushioned the blow a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful time and sharing it with my partner again was a significant factor in that. I can&apos;t wait to go back with her and be in my happy place with my favourite human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m seriously considering deleting my personal Twitter account because I&apos;ve had enough of the place. It started in 2020 with the BLM protests and the influx of unwanted attention, DMs, and people thinking they were helping but were making it uncomfortable to exist online. Pleas to be left alone were regularly ignored, diversity lists started popping up, requests for talks and then the sheer volume of tweets I just couldn&apos;t stomach: quote tweets of the worst kind of people and takes, and when you blocked them, you&apos;d see screenshots instead, traumatic images and videos, it was relentless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Elon Musk bought Twitter and it somehow got &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. Now, it&apos;s utterly horrendous and full of hatred, transphobia, right-wing propaganda, and Nazism in every kind of way. And people are getting paid to do it, with people engaging with it despite being told not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel for the people involved with grassroots organisations who had built networks to people fighting fascism now losing those connections and having to be subjected to it all with little-to-no means of combatting it on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&apos;m contemplating deleting my account. A big part of me wanted to write this to hold myself accountable rather than thinking anyone reading would care. Anyone close to me has contact with me elsewhere and anyone who&apos;d &quot;miss&quot; me could have spoken to me at any point up to now. I&apos;m reachable if you know where to look. As to when I might do this? I dunno. Soon? I&apos;ll have to think about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (5/11/23)&lt;/strong&gt;: Today, I deactivated my Twitter account deactivated and downloaded my archive. In 30 days, it&apos;ll be no more.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>I redesigned my site a little</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/site-redesign/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/site-redesign/</guid><description>You may have noticed the site looks a little different. Here&apos;s why I did made some design changes.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed the site looks a little different. That&apos;s because I decided to make some design changes. I haven&apos;t documented those changes anywhere so I&apos;ll explain what they are to the best of my knowledge and why I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ch-ch-ch-changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The header nav is smaller and more spread out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was heavily inspired by https://anhvn.com/ (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/i-also-love-my-website/&quot;&gt;who I posted in my last blog&lt;/a&gt;) and how she had a thinner header strip. It just looks neater. With making it smaller, I&apos;ve had to take out some of the links I didn&apos;t feel were worthy of a prominent place on every page on the site. That may change but for now, this is who it&apos;ll look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. I&apos;ve replaced Arial Black with Erode as the headings font&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember, I used to have two custom fonts for my main body and heading fonts but I thought it was silly to have the biggest files on my site in terms of size as fonts when the site was mostly text. It wasn&apos;t dragging UX performance down significantly but I wanted a site that could be loaded as fast as possible on all connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got bored of Arial Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took inspiration from Anh again and, rather than use Tiempos Text as well (1. I can&apos;t justify buying it and 2. I don&apos;t want to &lt;em&gt;copy&lt;/em&gt;.), I went to look for a free serif font with some sophistication. And that&apos;s when I found Erode. Luckily, its file size is small (about 23KB or something) and my Lighthouse scores are still all 100s (I know, I know, they don&apos;t mean anything but without the traffic, I can&apos;t use field data and I like round figures, okay?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it looks great and I&apos;m happy with my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Wiki is now &quot;Jardim&quot; and Wikinotes are now &quot;Recortes&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&apos;m not Portuguese but I&apos;ve been learning the language since 2017 and visited Lisbon 3 times (and I&apos;m going again next month). Besides Duolingo, I have no means of practice when I&apos;m not there so I felt a good way to break out of the app would be to add some of that &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;sabor português&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; into my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised that &quot;wiki&quot; wasn&apos;t working as a name for that area of my site and I was getting impressions for [KEYWORD + wiki] search terms which I didn&apos;t want. I also didn&apos;t want to call it a &quot;garden&quot; as, again, didn&apos;t want to copy so I went with &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;jardim&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;. That meant wikinotes had to go and, in keeping with the theme, I went with &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;recortes&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, which means &quot;cuttings&quot; in English. Like leaf cuttings or newspaper cuttings? &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&amp;gt;Double entendre!&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; This post is suddenly getting very multilingual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. I&apos;ve started using Content Collections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues with my site before was how content and dynamic pagination worked. I had to have folders in separate places with slightly different names that didn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example was all the blog posts had a URL slug of &lt;code&gt;/post/&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt;, the latter of which was only used for the index. Then, things like Release Notes and Morsels were housed under &lt;code&gt;/post/&lt;/code&gt; and they were their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Astro as my site framework and their Content Collections API has been around for a while. But I was wary of having to refactor my entire site and risk the loss of organic traffic (of what little traffic I get) but you know what? Screw it. I got sick of struggling and having messy code and folders so I did it over the course of two days. It wasn&apos;t easy but I figured stuff out and got it working. Then I fixed the broken links and set up redirects in the .htaccess file. And now things are better. So blog posts and the index are all under &lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Tags are gone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were a workaround and weren&apos;t great so nothing lost really, other than some internal linking. But there are better ways to do that, once I figure them out. There is a proper way to do it but one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks again to Anh for the inspiration to make those changes.&lt;/p&gt;

But it&apos;s mine.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://anhvn.com/&quot;&gt;anhvn.com&lt;/a&gt;, the personal site of Anh, a designer and artist based in Canada and I love it. Then I found one of her blog posts called &lt;a href=&quot;https://anhvn.com/posts/2021/2021-12-14-i-love-my-website/&quot;&gt;&quot;I love my website&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which was part of a chain following similar posts by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://winnielim.org/notes/i-love-my-website-too/&quot;&amp;gt;Winnie Lim&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tracydurnell.com/2021/11/19/personal-websites-are-the-best/&quot;&amp;gt;Tracy Durnell&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2021/11/16/i-love-my-website/&quot;&amp;gt;James&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/articles/10887&quot;&amp;gt;Jeremy Keith&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&apos;m here to jump on that bandwagon—I also love my website. This is like the 10th or 11th iteration of my personal website and this one is my favourite. It&apos;s still not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as streamlined as I&apos;d like it but it&apos;s just good enough to leave alone without expecting it to fall apart. Sure, Google likes to deindex a lot of my pages (which irks me as a full-time technical SEO) but it&apos;s all real and personal to me and that&apos;s precisely what you want from a &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, now that I&apos;ve seen Anh&apos;s &quot;redesigning in public&quot;, I&apos;m getting a teeny tiny itch to make some tweaks of my own. I can never sit still for &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; long when it comes to personal web design.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Being Black in digital marketing in 2023</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/</guid><description>In a follow-up to my 2020 piece ‘Being Black in Digital Marketing’, I asked the same Black marketers if anything has changed in the last 3 years.</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a follow-up to my 2020 piece ‘Being Black in Digital Marketing’, I asked the same Black marketers if anything has changed in the last 3 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened to me since I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/&quot;&gt;Being Black in Digital Marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed jobs, changed roles, and have built something of a reputation in the industry. But alongside that, many of the issues I raised in the original article remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I wasn’t surprised but I was still disheartened. Why was this still the case? Did those 3 years of listening and learning not make a difference? Why were there D&amp;amp;I initiative pages on agency websites but the Meet The Team pages were still predominantly white? It was something I just accepted before I entered the industry but I’ve been here for over 3 years now and I know I’m not the only one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this article, I spoke to some of the Black marketers who offered their thoughts 3 years ago, as well as some new ones, and asked them if they felt much had changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Participants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamar Ramos (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamarramos&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvtrevphotography.com/&quot;&gt;Trevor Price&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorprice89&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clarissa Ankrah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is office life like, 3 years later?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I referenced Black representation in digital marketing in relation to microaggressions and “the experience starting and stopping at being a minority”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jamar Ramos, there have been some marked improvements but racism still persists—albeit from a different source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pre-2020, office life was terrible. I hated traveling 60+ minutes to get to, and leave, the office. I hated dealing with multiple meetings that could have been emails. I hated ignoring so many racist comments passed off as ‘jokes.’ Post-2020, the travel was better, the meeting load was the same, and the racist comments/jokes came from clients instead of coworkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He elaborated on that, showing that microaggressions are still prevalent in the SEO space in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clients consistently asked me what I did for the company, even though in email correspondence and on our company website, it was clear what I did. Now that I’m job hunting, the hoops I have to jump through and the consistent focus on the SEO aspects I don’t know intimately are very bothersome. I’ve also been told that a role I’d been recruited for was off the table because the company didn&apos;t have the budget for hiring anymore, only to watch that same company hire a white dude a few weeks later. All those black squares didn’t lead people to mirror their words to their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer &lt;a href=&quot;https://msha.ke/tv_trev/&quot;&gt;Trevor Price&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t seen much change outside of COVID safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Office life pre and post 2020 has more or less been the same save for some house keeping regarding covid safety practice. It has been pleasant but not necessarily pleasing if that makes sense. Office culture in my experience rarely changes as it has to be a major shift in the way a business operates for that to happen. For any successful business, the old adage of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind, however with industries unintentionally (or in some cases intentionally) dominated by a white (usually male) workforce they may not realise the system is broken until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarissa Ankrah didn’t feel supported when she joined the industry in a few years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed having the flexibility to work abroad and take regular trips back to attend office days. It gave me a good sense of balance to connect with the team and explore new surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, starting a new field of marketing was challenging, and I sometimes found it difficult to seek support from my manager. I also found myself code-switching as the only black woman working for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Black women, the microaggressions are still more acute and stronger. In an article by Daphna Motro, Jonathan B. Evans, Aleksander P.J. Ellis, and Lehman Benson III entitled ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-angry-black-woman-stereotype-at-work&quot;&gt;The “Angry Black Woman” Stereotype at Work&lt;/a&gt;’, they looked at how the racist trope pervades office life in the US and prevent Black women from speaking out against discrimination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[...] Studies show people in organizations believe Black women are more likely to have belligerent, contentious, and angry personalities, an assumption not as readily assigned to other men and women. Recent studies suggest this negative perception is a unique phenomenon for Black women, and the researchers suggest that when Black women outwardly express anger at work, her leadership and potential are called into question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-women-office-culture&quot;&gt;for Black women like Lola Christina Alao&lt;/a&gt;, office culture has been a drain, mentally and physically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black women, like me, are often at a crossroads between wanting to take a stand against microaggressions at work and wanting to fade into the background to protect our peace. Being in the office, for me, meant feeling drained by 3pm, flattened by the weight of endless small talk and the constant pressure to be social, then the exhaustion I felt when I was judged for not wanting to be social.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Johnson, who offered her opinions back in 2020, said there are pros and cons to working remotely but described some specific disadvantages for Black women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, in September 2020 I switched organizations and have been fully remote ever since. In some ways it&apos;s been really nice - I get to roll out of bed and go straight to my office, and I don&apos;t have a long commute to downtown Chicago so I get to spend more time with my husband and dogs, but also there are some things that I know I&apos;m missing out on. I think this is true for everyone, but for black women in particular the face time that can come by being in office is REALLY important for relationship building and camaraderie. Otherwise, and I say this from experience, some people don&apos;t respect your role in the org and question your expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence has seen some positive shifts compared to 3 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pre-2020, office life was teeming with microaggressions under the guise of &apos;humour&apos;. I left a job where I felt like the angry black woman narrative was being pushed on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-2020, the conversations around race are approached more sensitively and Black people that I know feel more comfortable speaking up and pushing back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I remarked on the lack of Black voices in digital marketing publications and conferences. I have seen a small shift since then, thanks to the likes of Rejoice Ojiaku, Wilhelmina Gilbert-Davis, Anu Adegbola, Miracle Inameti-Archibong, and many more, particularly in the conference space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, two prominent articles were published regarding the Black experience in digital marketing. The first was by Carla Thomas, former content strategist at Builtvisible, who wrote “&lt;a href=&quot;https://builtvisible.com/lets-talk-about-race-and-diversity-breaking-glass-ceilings-in-digital-marketing-and-beyond/&quot;&gt;Let’s talk about race and diversity: breaking glass ceilings in digital marketing and beyond&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2020 is a year that will go down in history. Amongst a swirl of magnifying events around the world, a well-needed spotlight was shone on race and diversity issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically to the creative industries, in July [2020] The Independent reported that a lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the advertising industry leads to stereotyping; stereotyping which often harms society. Putting the importance of needing to reflect a realistic society aside, from a business standpoint diversity is proven to assist with accessing new customers and diversifying a customer base. Although we still have a long way to go, the good news is that the needle on workplace diversity is shifting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in February 2021, as part of the Black History Month in the US, Adobe wrote “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/02/19/being-a-black-digital-marketer-in-2021&quot;&gt;Being a Black digital marketer in 2021&lt;/a&gt;”. In it, they spoke to a variety of Black marketers about their experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many Black digital marketers talk regularly about “being the only Black person in the room” and how uncomfortable that can feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having worked in various offices in my decades-long career, I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t either the only Black person in the office or one of a very small handful,” said Kelly Coleman, executive director of e-commerce at Tarte Cosmetics, where she builds and maintains innovative and effective customer experiences across all of Tarte’s digital properties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jamar, who had previous said he “hated being Black in digital marketing”, not much has changed in his outlook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I could make a career change, I would. I like the money I can make and the people I’ve met. But, unfortunately, the industry talks about moving forward but consistently holds steady. Individuals want to make change, but institutions keep that change at bay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zenia has felt a shift in how she approaches microaggressions, in that she actively approaches them compared to earlier in her digital marketing career:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having worked in digital marketing for my adult career I&apos;ve had to work very closely with product and engineering teams - teams that tend to be very male and very white. Early in my career I felt uncomfortable confronting the microaggressions that would be leveled against me, or would question that I was even experiencing a microaggression. To give a few examples, I remember I was managing a team that included a man, and some people would go to him directly for advice or strategy and I was his manager. Or, to give another example (that has actually happened more than once!), when &quot;soul&quot; food was catered in the office, I would get a million questions about the greens and whether they were the &quot;real deal.&quot; I truly hope that white people have learned not to turn to the black person in the room when they get soul food delivered in the office (but in case they haven&apos;t, I&apos;m even more grateful to be remote). Now that I&apos;m a little further along in my career I don&apos;t put up with that and call it out when it&apos;s happening. I just reached the point where I couldn&apos;t code-switch or minimize my own feelings anymore, and I feel totally comfortable confronting a microaggression leveled against me or a junior team member who needs support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa also discussed her experiences with microaggressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Comments about my hair texture. Being pulled up on my tone of voice because simply being friendly isn&apos;t enough. I had to overcompensate to be viewed the same as non-Black peers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on her general experiences in digital marketing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Generally positive but I am well aware that that&apos;s mainly because I&apos;m good at code-switching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarissa’s experience with microaggressions involved use of both Black British Vernacular English and AAVE (African American Vernacular English):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of eye-opening experiences stunned me in my first role in digital marketing. I did feel at times that my former manager (a White male) did not know how to converse with me as a black woman. He would have a conversation in his dialect and occasionally would switch to using AAVE with me (I think that&apos;s the right term) by using phrases like &quot;you go girrrl&quot; or &quot;girrl&quot; (in an American accent I might add) to what I can only think to relate or converge with me, conversationally as an employee.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
In another event on a team call, they made a statement in an attempt to try and be &quot;funny&apos; by saying &quot;mans a roadman innit?&quot; (with hand gestures) - everyone but myself laughed on that call. I suppose thinking of the connotations and the demographic of who the media and society label a &quot;roadman&quot; it did make me feel very uncomfortable and a small-minded comment to make that can be damaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And her experience in marketing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven&apos;t worked for many digital marketing companies or agencies but since leaving my previous role, matters have definitely improved. Working for a company that is more receptive to feedback to push diversity and support ethnic minorities as well as support their mental wellbeing is something I appreciate.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Continuous training, mental wellbeing and pushing for diversity should be championed and implemented across the board.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
For me, I’ve seen shifts but plenty of stagnation. People are still asking Black marketers to make themselves known to conference organisers and people making Twitter and publications lists, solely for the purpose of diversity. The question shouldn’t be how can we improve diversity and that question be left at the doors of Black marketers, it should be “why can’t the most prominent figures in an industry name more than one or two Black people—if that—to promote or offer a space on their panel?” And why are there constant calls for these lists and recommendations with no significant action at a recruitment or company level? What are these lists actually for? The sooner these questions are answered and actions made off the back of them, the better for our experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Racial biases in search—technically and personally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catherinestinson.ca/Files/Papers/Algorithms_are_not_Neutral.pdf&quot;&gt;Algorithms are not neutral [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;”, Catherine Stinson examined the bias found in algorithms and how they undermine people from marginalised groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People from minority communities have noted that recommender algorithms do not work well for them. Noble documents the ways that search algorithms fail to serve the needs of black women. One of her examples is a hair salon owner who struggled to get her business to show up as a recommendation on Yelp when you search for “‘African American’, ‘Black’, ‘relaxer’, ‘natural”’, as keywords. Complaints about culturally inappropriate recommendations, such as white hairdressers being recommended for those search terms, or Christmas movies being recommended to non-Christians, are common online. Popularity and homogenizing biases may be at fault in those examples. A related issue arises when the recommender system does figure out that a user belongs to a minority group, but overfits to an essentialized version of that identity. That you cannot escape ads for Rupaul’s Drag Race if your online presence reveals any interest in LGBTQ+ issues stems from over-specialization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is some empirical evidence for differential effects of algorithmic bias on demographic groups. [...] Zafar et al. discuss “disparate mistreatment”, which arises when a classifier’s misclassification rates differ across social groups. An example (which stems from data bias) is how the COMPAS algorithm made more false positive errors with black defendants, labeling people who would not reoffend as being high risk while making more false negative errors with white defendants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those situations where there have been improvements but not enough and not on a wider scale. And it’s something companies like Google acknowledge and state they can’t solve outside of specific use cases that marginalised people draw their attention to. In that case, why should I trust any of the company’s search or wide AI advancements? Won’t they carry racial bias? I’m tired of shrugging my shoulders at the lack of energy to stop harming people who look like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an industry perspective, Jamar noted the defence of bigoted rhetoric in relation to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LidiaInfanteM/status/1582352202781569024&quot;&gt;a tweet calling out the male bias of “SEO experts” in a SERP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[...] when they reply with some tone-deaf argument that women and minorities need to do the work to change Google’s results when you look up SEO experts, racism in the industry is alive and well.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
We have too many people who think this way and drop some respectability politics into the mentions to defend it. [...] Nothing we do can change the algorithm or the content it scrapes. That change needs to come from the SEOs making the lists and content that Google scrapes. The change needs to come from privileged white males, and this asinine need to make women and minorities do all the work to dismantle their oppression systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor believed, to his knowledge, there had been no major shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia concurred:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Has much changed? I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m still seeing the same lists published of &quot;best ppc experts&quot; or &quot;top SEOs&quot; of 2022, and they&apos;re all mostly white and mostly men. Conference headliners still skew very white and male. Leadership teams are still white and male.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Melissa did too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&apos;t work exclusively in search but I am aware that many panels, conferences and events still centre white males as their most trusted contributors. More still needs to be done in the mainstream events to shine a spotlight on Black professionals in the industry - not because we&apos;re Black but because we&apos;re talented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarissa said she was disappointed by major brands’ inaction against racial bias until the damage was done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&apos;s not something I noticed in my role at first, but I am aware of some AI presenting racial biases to black people. One thing I read a little while ago was that white content creators were able to monetise hateful terms and Google didn&apos;t blacklist this until being prompted to.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
It&apos;s very disappointing when big companies brand themselves on being just and prohibiting hateful speech, but not taking systems to block this right away when they clearly have the resources to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I referenced a piece by Chanda Prescod-Weinstein called &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/space-anthropology/diversity-is-a-dangerous-set-up-8cee942e7f22&quot;&gt;‘Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up’&lt;/a&gt; where she said trying to use science to analyse and fix racism was a dangerous proposition and that focusing on implicit bias at the expense of explicit bias and its impact could be harmful to the fight for equality. This year, she wrote a follow-up/reiterative piece entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion&quot;&gt;‘About your diversity and inclusion requirement’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I almost feel silly writing this piece because I have written some version of it so many times. I wrote Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up and the Rules of the Diversity and Inclusion Racket. I also wrote long ago about the problems with the broader impacts criterion leading to students of color being treated like diversity props and minoritized scholars shouldn’t be forced to serve diversity.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I wrote, “The diversity racket is this: thinking that this is an intellectual exercise in being magnanimous, not a matter of survival.” I even wrote a whole chapter in my book about unwaged academic housework.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
So I am tired and feel a bit silly but mostly furious because it is both ridiculous and deeply outrageous that it is necessary to write about this topic again, and surely this will not be the last time.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
But also, as my grandmother Selma has said to me: I am shocked, but not surprised. Very little about the institutional relationship with “equity, diversity, and inclusion,” “diversity and inclusion,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and it’s newly extra woke iteration “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion” (JEDI, ha! so cute) surprises me. Because the institution’s goal is to survive, not to be better to us or for us. Our survival is not the institution’s goal. Our well-being is not the institution’s goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor suggested diversity needed to be more specific and that more people from non-marginalised groups are speaking out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honestly it means too many things to too many people. It comes down to the organisation and what fits their environment. If they are recruiting and they find that their applicants all look like clones, there’s likely a problem. The difference post-2020 is that now everyone is noticing it and feels empowered to point it out as opposed to just those affected by the lack of diversity (whether that’s race, gender or disability).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia believes organisational shifts have only been superficial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it means that organizations are more aware of the optics - they know what diversity should look like, they know the language to make it seem like they support diversity, but that hasn&apos;t resulted in meaningful change. Hiring practices are still the same, and these organizations have largely refused to re-invest in the communities that have been pillaged by decades of negligence and harmful capitalistic practices. The only difference is now there&apos;s maybe a DEI meeting once a quarter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Melissa wants to see a little less conversation and a little more action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It means almost the same but that people in leadership are being forced to actually pay attention to its meaning and the action. Back your chat, basically. I don&apos;t want to hear that you&apos;re listening and learning, I want to see that you&apos;re providing support, resources and opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarissa believes diversity should be a responsibility at every level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 2020, in the months of the Black Lives Matter protests, it was a time to bring to light the injustices but also showed support for black businesses, key figures and trailblazers all over the world. It presented the need for allyship and also recognised white privilege and how you can create a community with others by being open and willing to learn about the past, present and future.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I strongly believe that diversity needs to be in all areas, especially seniority. I say this because when their roles involve individuals, their wellbeing and progress, it&apos;s empowering and welcomes other perspectives which I believe is key to progression. I believe with a lot of things it&apos;s important to be intentional.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
There tends to be an ongoing concern with performativity in organisations (I see it discussed with Black people I follow on social media) and how it is perceived by others. To me, this means not just speaking out about matters until certain events of the year (i.e. Black History Month) or until others are doing so. I can understand it can be (for a lack of a better word) scary, but it sets precedent for being unapologetically authentic.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Also, collaborating with others that are positively trying to make the digital marketing space by offering a soundboard for conversations to offer other perspectives is really important. As well as, cultivating relationships to be able to learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My efforts within D&amp;amp;I have certainly evolved over the last 3 years. The Black Lives Matter protests radicalised me more than I expected and I’ve been more active in terms of donations to grassroots organisations and being vocal in the space. I started a newsletter this year that focuses on diversity and inclusivity within recruitment and retention and learnt (and unlearnt) a lot about what D&amp;amp;I should mean. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to bring “diversity” and “inclusivity” out of their buzzword comfort zones and into a reality where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workplaces have marginalised people at every level, not because it makes “business sense” but because marginalised people work too (is there ever a specific business case for employing white British men in the UK?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can feel safe to work and socialise without fear of micro and macroaggressions which get vehemently defended and subsequently backed up by HR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can choose their own career path that doesn’t involve stunted growth patterns and goalpost shifting when it comes to promotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They aren’t looked to for involvement in diversity and inclusion initiatives purely because they’re from a marginalised background and then made to feel utterly exhausted to the point they have to leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened to the industry pledges after 2020?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of pledges and responses to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 after George Floyd’s murder. We were told that eyes were opened, people stood with us as Black people, and that our voices would be amplified. But what has that all meant 3 years later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia praised her current employers for their subsequent actions but expressed her sadness at the lack of action from wider organisations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company that I&apos;m at currently, Outside Inc., has put forth a ton of effort DEI (sic). There is still work to do, but there is investment in third-party resources to continuously grade the organization and hold it accountable. I love that about this company, but I wish it held true everywhere. I have friends of color in the industry - at agencies and in-house, and they&apos;ve seen very little follow-up to those demonstrative pledges. Yeah sure, you turned the org&apos;s social profile pic black, but what happened after that? It just feels so disheartening, and has caused a lot of my friends to divest from participation in DEI initiatives because they&apos;re not seeing results or meaningful change. They&apos;re doing the work elsewhere - via community organizations, mentorship, etc.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I&apos;ve also decided to take a break from participation in DEI work at work. Even being at an org that is doing the work well, I&apos;m very tired. Working directly with mentees feels like more actionable and meaningful work for me right now. And to be frank, black folks have always done this work. After the disappointment of the last two years, it&apos;s ok for us to step back and take a break. It&apos;s time for allies to step in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamar echoed this sadness more strongly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The industry is okay with proximity to equity without any tangible equity being given. Conference lineups look relatively the same, and organizers continue asking women and minorities to nominate themselves for talks instead of doing work to identify new voices. In the months after George Floyd’s murder, I was hopeful the industry wanted to change. Now, I’m sure it doesn’t, and those of us who do will either need to work within a system that actively hates us or find solutions in other industries we might see a warmer welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa pointed out a need for better mental health support for Black employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as the companies I have close contact with, I definitely see the conversations being continued but I&apos;d like to see more support for Black people&apos;s mental health in the industry. Our experiences are uniquely different and so the resources should be too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to see what changes have been made when the pledges haven’t been reassessed a year or two later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/black-lives-matter&quot;&gt;Moz wrote a statement in response to the BLM protests in June 2020,&lt;/a&gt; followed by an update two days later responding to calls for evidence of their existing work. But no other updates since. On a personal level, I know my Twitter DMs were full of messages from non-Black colleagues asking for “sense checks” on statements, guilt, confirmation that I was “seen and heard”. It was very overwhelming and they continued even after I asked for them to stop. But they did eventually and after the dust settled, they rarely spoke to me about anything at all. And that’s how it has felt at an industry level since 2020. There are themed months on blogs, icon changes, and then 1st November arrives and it’s back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion&quot;&gt;About your diversity and inclusion requirement&lt;/a&gt;”, I empathise with her fatigue. It feels like a constant cycle of Black trauma bringing attention to systemic racism and people and enterprises becoming “aware”, making pledges, and watching the energy disappear over the space of a month. And Black people are always the one doing the work, making things known, and demanding change at every conceivable level whilst experiencing microaggressions, being passed up for promotions, getting fired, or not even finding work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within digital marketing, we’re acutely aware of racial biases in the search engine algorithms but also at an industry level in the lack of Black speakers at marketing conferences and Black marketers in agencies. And it’s not a case of nobody is doing anything but the actions are small and concentrated and can take a very long time to implement. They also need applied pressure—often from Black employees—to avoid them falling into the cracks. Amongst mounting deadlines and a mental health crisis amongst Black communities, it’s difficult to maintain that energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question becomes: where do we go from here, and who is “we”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We” should be everyone, regardless of race. That’s because white supremacy affects non-Black people too through non-racial discrimination. Therefore, institutional diversity and inclusion should be the work of everybody in an institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reminder of what I suggested 3 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively call for Black candidates for all open roles and hire them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer multiple paths for progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make intersectionality and inclusion prerequisites of working life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide transparency in salaries at all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still believe these things are necessary for Black marketers to feel more comfortable in their roles and places within the industry but I’d like to take it back further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend everybody reckon with their own biases and the discomfort that comes with it. Too much of this work is obscured by guilt, a need to apologise to Black people for “The Past”, and seeking redemption. It’s not up to Black people to absolve the guilt of others. This defers the grace and space we should all give ourselves to acknowledge and do better. Once we face ourselves, then we can start looking outward and call out the discrimination before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, it’s lifelong learning and action. That’s not the same as the listening and learning we heard incessantly in 2020 that amounted to nothing after the summer. There were plenty of anti-racism book lists published and, for some, those books were bought and left to collect dust on the shelf. The reading is a part of it but it’s not the full work. We also need to be mindful of what biases we perpetuate in our digital marketing. That includes optimising page titles that only say “Black man” or “Black woman” alongside negative stories— write their names . We also need to assess who we work with when it comes to link building. Many of the top news publications have histories of racism. Can we keep overlooking this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, make Black people feel welcome. One of the primary results of microaggressions is to exclude, and often these exclusions are masked as obstacles or barriers of entry that &quot;affects everyone, regardless of race&quot;. By doing the prior work, we can make healthy, open, and safe environments for Black colleagues to be themselves and grow but also choose not to be involved as is their prerogative. As for those barriers of entry, they need to be checked too, and &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; an incident occurs that causes unnecessary harm or frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

Obtaining them has been made a lot easier in recent years, with Dynamax Adventures in Sword &amp;amp; Shield, and Ultra Wormholes in Ultra Sun &amp;amp; Ultra Moon. Those games can take a long time to complete to get there so I figured playing the older games would be a lot quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That endeavour meant I&apos;ve played &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of Pokémon and moving them through multiple consoles. This week alone (14th–20th August 2023), I&apos;ve done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed Red and caught the Legendary Birds and Mewtwo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed the first part of Crystal and caught the Legendary Beasts, Lugia, and Ho-Oh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed Emerald and caught Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, the Regis, Latios, Latias&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;latias_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#latias&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Lugia and Ho-Oh&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;lugia-ho-oh_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#lugia-ho-oh&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Deoxys&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;deoxys_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#deoxys&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and Mew&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;mew_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#mew&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been gruelling but worth it as it meant I could finally finish Emerald for the first time (I only ever played Sapphire) and create teams of Pokémon I&apos;d never used before. The most difficult thing to get so far has been the Faraway Island Mew from a Japanese copy of Pokémon Emerald. That involved playing through the game (with help from Google Translate), getting to use the ticket, and then trading it to my English copy of Emerald. But it&apos;s there now and ready for the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-gb/get-mew-mewtwo/&quot;&gt;Get Mew &amp;amp; Mewtwo! Raid&lt;/a&gt; in SV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 20th August, I&apos;m currently on Pokémon Platinum which will give me the following legendaries and mythicals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giratina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uxie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azelf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mesprit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dialga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palkia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heatran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regigigas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cresselia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articuno&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapdos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moltres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regirock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registeel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darkrai&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;gen4_mythical_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#gen4_mythicals&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaymin&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;gen4_mythical_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#gen4_mythicals&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arceus&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;gen4_mythical_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#gen4_mythicals&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be updating this through my quest and will likely update my &lt;a href=&quot;https://centiskor.ch/logs/my-pokemon-teams/&quot;&gt;Pokémon teams list&lt;/a&gt; to document who got me through each game. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;ol style=&quot;font-size:80%;&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;latias&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#latias_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;^&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Using the EON Ticket
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;lugia-ho-oh&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#lugia-ho-oh_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;^&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Using the MysticTicket&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;deoxys&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#deoxys_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;^&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Using the AuroraTicket&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;mew&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#mew_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;^&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Using the Old Sea Map on a Japanese copy of Emerald
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sup id=&quot;gen4_mythicals&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#gen4_mythical_ref&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;^&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; I either won&apos;t go for these or I will but won&apos;t trade them up to Home as they wouldn&apos;t be legal &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You can&apos;t stop me, The Pokémon Company!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;

They have some cool SEO behind them.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Something I&apos;ve been doing recently is looking for Pokémon nickname ideas. I&apos;ll search &quot;Pokémon + nickname&quot; and the site I always go to, regardless of rank, is PKMN.NET. They have a section called The Name Rater where people submit their nicknames and the name rater rates them with a healthy dose of snark and cynicism. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe&quot;&gt;kayfabe&lt;/a&gt; was real!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkmn.net/&quot;&gt;PKMN.NET&lt;/a&gt; is a UK Pokémon fan website and forum, founded by Psythor (James O&apos;Malley), which officially opened on 10th January 2000. And It does remarkably well for these &quot;Pokémon + nickname&quot; queries. You&apos;ll often find them ranking in second place which is great going but the remarkable part is that the pages aren&apos;t optimised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the metadata for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&amp;amp;page=pokemon&amp;amp;id=9&quot;&gt;Blastoise&apos;s Name Rater page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta title: Name Raters :: PKMN.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta description: PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL: &lt;code&gt;https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&amp;amp;page=pokemon&amp;amp;id=9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H1: N/A (in fact, there are no headings on this page)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re an SEO reading this, you might be having heart palpitations right now and I totally understand if you need to stop reading to get some fresh air and calm your nerves. How could they not have optimised metadata? And that URL! And no headings???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But read that meta description again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-33&quot;&gt;a recent interview with The Johto Times&lt;/a&gt;, the accolade of being &quot;one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites&quot; is true. Those nickname submissions also date as far back as 2007. Sites like this would have had a lot of traffic back then and while it might have decreased, they&apos;ll maintain a steady stream today. I did a rough &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/&quot;&gt;Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt; search of over 400 &quot;Pokémon + nicknames&quot; queries (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fuecoco nicknames&lt;/code&gt;) and found average monthly search volumes of up to 900 and total of 29,000. If you&apos;re ranking #2-#10 for something as niche as Pokémon nicknames without any optimisation, you&apos;re doing really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are plenty of other factors contributing to this and the main one is probably links. Another check on Ahrefs showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;26,000 ranking keywords for the pkmn.net domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 45,000 backlinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;712 referring domains, of which 449 had follow links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The domains with the highest DRs were wikihow.com, neocities.org, adblockplus.org, and tvtropes.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, that&apos;ll do it. They&apos;re serving the user what they need (Pokémon nicknames), adding something unique (a snarky persona), it&apos;s &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; user-generated content, and they have a healthy link profile. And all without targeted metadata and headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&apos;s my point? Well, the reason I&apos;m writing this besides my love of Pokémon and my habit of looking at websites from an SEO perspective outside work hours is because of CNET. You might have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seroundtable.com/google-cnet-content-pruning-plans-35876.html&quot;&gt;their recent announcement about content pruning&lt;/a&gt; to try and improve their search vsibility and traffic. It was polarising and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lukealexdavis_seo-research-history-activity-7095694487791775744-Savl/&quot;&gt;I shared my feelings&lt;/a&gt; (before deleting them and resharing with added nuance). I felt that deleting archival content was a bad thing for those looking to the past for context and general discovery. Yes, information about AOL in 1996 isn&apos;t relevant to today&apos;s technology we can&apos;t just delete historical data because it doesn&apos;t suit us in the present. What&apos;s more, CNET are publishing AI-generated content, likely at scale, which will fill the gap and arguably muddy the waters of their site quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to PKNN.NET, I think their site is an example of keeping something outdated in modern Web/search standards and it paying off in terms of organic performance. I&apos;m sure it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be better but it&apos;s not terrible right now. I can&apos;t be the only one who has visited their site when looking for nicknames and come away with some idea, even if I didn&apos;t take what was there. The site gave me &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in an old fashioned way and I think any unoptimised site owners that can do that should think really hard about the ramifications of culling large portions of their site for little-to-no SEO gains, only to then fill the gaps with AI-generated drivel.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s the thing that gets you to the thing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend on Twitter about how large language models (LLMs) have helped me get work done in a roundabout way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a writing perspective, I&apos;ve not known where to start sometimes so I&apos;ve prompted a LLM to write what I needed. Naturally, it was crap so I then just rewrote it completely. I got the job done. Had I started from 0, I may have struggled for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, by chance, I found an article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepakg.com/bringing-19th-century-ornamental-tile-illustrations-into-a-21st-century-web-app&quot;&gt;a cool web app that lets you create 19th century ornamental tile illustrations&lt;/a&gt;. The last paragraph was the part that struck a timely chord (with the key phrase in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the initial drafts of this tool were at least partially generated by ChatGPT 4. They never came close to anything you could simply use, but they were instrumental in showing me what’s possible. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;More importantly, they greatly lowered the inertia I would have to overcome to start building something like this in the first place.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We live in interesting times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that idea; &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/ai/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started. It seems counterproductive to prompt a LLM to write something, only to completely rewrite it and yet it&apos;s more effective than starting at a blank screen. And I think that comes down to not knowing how or where to start, seeing something that just isn&apos;t right and improving on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a Ship of Theseus for the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&apos;s why nuance is needed when talking about its relationship with SEO</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a technical SEO, I am very passionate about web performance. The speed and overall performance of a page can affect how well a search engine crawler can crawl and index a page (amongst many other factors). The usual way to define that is through metrics like Google&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/articles/vitals/&quot;&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt;, which form part of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience&quot;&gt;Page Experience ranking signal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href =&quot;#sidenote&quot;&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. But there&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve noticed between both SEO and web performance communities: people are giving too much weight to Core Web Vitals from a ranking perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&apos;m going to use an example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speedcurve.com/&quot;&gt;Speedcurve&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate this. I don&apos;t think the information on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance&quot;&gt;SEO and Web Performance&lt;/a&gt; is terrible or incorrect but I feel like some caveats are important to avoid misunderstandings or heated debates between businesses and their in-house SEOs/agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the section titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance#how-much-does-web-performance-matter-when-it-comes-to-seo&quot;&gt;How much does web performance matter when it comes to SEO?&lt;/a&gt;, they say the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Web Vitals were announced, they&apos;ve shot to the top of many people&apos;s list of things to care about. But Google&apos;s prioritization of page speed in search ranking isn&apos;t new, even for mobile. As far back as 2013, Google announced that pages that load slowly on mobile devices would be penalized in mobile search.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Performance has had an impact on SEO long before Web Vitals came along. Back in 2011, Smartfurniture.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/the-growing-need-for-speed-how-site-performance-increasingly-influences-search-rankings&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&quot;We discovered we could make a quantum leap in search engine rankings simply by increasing site performance. Across the board, we’ve seen sales increases because of our improved ranking, with 20% more organic traffic being driven to our site and 14% more page views.&quot;
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
More recently, Pinterest &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7#.wwimdmkpp&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; that rebuilding their site with performance in mind resulted in a 15% increase in organic search traffic. (You can find more SEO-related case studies at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpostats.com/tags/seo/&quot;&gt;WPOstats.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the Speed Update really meant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flag for me was regarding Google&apos;s penalisation of slow sites in mobile search. There was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search&quot;&gt;announcement in 2018 in a Google blog post&lt;/a&gt; but &quot;penalised&quot; is a problematic word to use in this context (and &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; news sites ran with it at the time). The reason for that is because Google has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509&quot;&gt;manual penalty system&lt;/a&gt; for serious cases such as black hat tactics such as keyword cloaking, keyword stuffing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/private-blog-network&quot;&gt;private blog networks (or PBNs)&lt;/a&gt;, and misleading redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get caught, Google &quot;penalises&quot; you by dropping your rank or deindexing completely. Most people are aware of these kinds of penalties so using that terminology to describe the effects of having a slow site can give the wrong connotations. So to be clear and diligent, a slow site will not tank your rankings directly. Sites that have issues that don&apos;t allow them to be crawled and indexed correctly will see rankings fall and slow speeds could be associative in those cases but not the primary or sole cause. &lt;em&gt;Hope that makes sense; let me know if not! x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important paragraph from the 2018 blog post is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Speed Update&quot;, as we&apos;re calling it, will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this isn&apos;t necessarily sitewide, it only affects a small portion of queries, and a slow page might not see a change in rank because of its content relevance. And that&apos;s how seach should work. The biggest sites in terms of indexed pages and popularity are in the vast minority on the Web. A lot of them are also memory, storage, data, and time hogs. You don&apos;t see them falling down the rankings or out of them completely so perhaps speed isn&apos;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; big a deal compared to other signals like content relevance, link profiles, and efficient crawling and indexation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web performance doesn&apos;t always correlate with organic ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;float-img-right&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/i-make-lots-of-graphs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lisa Simpson holding up a graph with the caption &apos;I make a lot of graphs&apos;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Lisa is clearly an SEO.&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few studies were quoted in the referenced Speedcurve paragraph, from Smartfurniture.com and Pinterest. Now, case studies are important to show how changes can have significant impacts—good or bad. But it is so difficult to attribute web performance changes in SEO without taking other factors into account. You often see percentages and monetary figures but rarely what happened to get to those stages. And then there are the confusions between users engaging with SERPs (search engine results pages) and users engaging with the site once they click the SERP listing link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, a slow page may still rank highly so you can&apos;t attribute performance improvements to improved impressions or clicks. Factors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seasonal-seo-tips/438300/&quot;&gt;seasonality&lt;/a&gt;, competitors, updates, content relevance, and link profiles make a bigger difference on that front. Once you&apos;re on the page, then speed can become a factor. But what happens if you make content changes at the same time? Or change the links on the page? Which one made the most difference? It&apos;s hard to say for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s not to say I doubt that improving web performance makes a difference to conversions and general organic performance but it requires a methodology and careful analysis to attribute the changes to the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who Core Web Vitals is really for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance#which-performance-metrics-should-you-focus-on-for-seo&quot;&gt;Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?&lt;/a&gt; examines metrics to look out for when measuring performance and where you can improve. There are four listed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/articles/lcp&quot;&gt;Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/articles/fid&quot;&gt;First Input Delay (FID)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/articles/inp/&quot;&gt;Interaction to Next Paint (INP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/articles/cls&quot;&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCP, FID, and CLS are currently the Core Web Vitals metrics, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv&quot;&gt;INP will replace FID in March 2024&lt;/a&gt;. As Google created these as best measures for web performance (in their eyes, and they know they aren&apos;t perfect), I agree these should be metrics to focus on. But my issue is with the title:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which performance metrics should you focus on for &amp;lt;span style=&quot;color:#FC1420;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I get that this whole page is about SEO and web performance but users are the common denominator at every stage of the journey. A site can rank #1 for a term and very few people click on the link in the SERPs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-are-dark-patterns/&quot;&gt;thanks, Google Ads!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they do though, they navigate the site, may convert, may not, may abandon their cart, may not, may leave, may come back, may not. All of that may be because of site speed or visual shifts. Or it could be people being indecisive or wanting to save money. UX plays a crucial part in all of that, which is why Core Web Vitals and web performance shouldn&apos;t be so tightly bound with SEO; it should be connected with UX in a cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeMcG5OT5BU&quot;&gt;Ring a Ring o&apos; Roses&lt;/a&gt;-type relationship. Oh, and devs too. They can join in... I guess!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/images/stone-cold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white male wrestler named Stone Cold, wearing some black briefs and boots talking into a mic with anger. He was famous for uttering the line &apos;and that&apos;s the bottom line cos Stone Cold said so&apos;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Me in a client meeting.&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Web Vitals emphasizes the relationship between UX and SEO when it comes to impact and results. I feel like a broken record for saying this (at least in my head) but improving CWV metrics won&apos;t boost organic rankings without a lot of caveats but it most certainly will improve organic session quality, leading to better session duration, conversions, and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users don&apos;t know how slow your site is in the SERPs but they&apos;ll find out once they click the link so prepare for that part and let helpful content, link building, and EEAT do the preliminary work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of message we need to send to clients and our peers when discussing why CWV is important. We need to be specific or we&apos;re gonna look like snake oil merchants (oh wait, we already do: look at SEO&apos;s reputation with devs and the media *side-eyes The Verge*)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I&apos;m not trying to pick on Speedcurve or suggesting they suck or they&apos;re telling lies (I actually like their product and the people I know of that work there as they do really awesome work in the web performance sector so thank you!) My overrarching point is this: when we talk about SEO and web performance, we need to refrain from saying things like &quot;improving site speed is a ranking factor and doing so will improve your SEO ranking&quot;. Those kinds of statements are either not true or barely true or only giving a small portion of the information needed to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real truth is that Page Experience is just one signal amongst many others and within Page Experience, Core Web Vitals is one part of many. That means it&apos;s not heavily weighted and people (who know that) should be saying it. At the moment, I fear that people thinking there&apos;s an equal weight to content, links, and page speed when that just isn&apos;t the case. Where page speed &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; heavily weighted is in direct user experiences and people&apos;s abilities to navigate websites in a way that makes them stay, return, and feel comfortable to do both. If it&apos;s a commercial site, they&apos;re more likely to buy stuff or sign up to stuff. If it&apos;s informational, they&apos;re more likely to read and comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will always click links on SERPs. They might not always stay on your site for long. Web performance is therefore more important for the latter than the former and SEO, UX, dev work, and higher-ups buy-in should work together to make that all happen and make everyone happy. Or happier at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p id=&quot;sidenote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;*Please note: Page Experience is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a ranking system and Google has said that before and I don&apos;t want to piss Danny Sullivan off any more than he likely seems to be when people misattribute his/Google&apos;s official documentation, even if it isn&apos;t always &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; clear but I digress.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s basically a manual index and I found that fascinating. Even in 2023, I love the idea of collecting websites and links and displaying them for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, what I&apos;m referring to is a Web directory and they&apos;re long out of fashion but the purpose of them has never died - informational retrieval and discoverability. I think a lot of that has been lost in our current stage of Informational Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has been around in search for way longer than OpenAI et al. It&apos;s all various elements of computer science and machine learning. But this focus on generative AI is a big concern to me because it&apos;s muddying the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not saying we&apos;re going back to directories and pages of links. But generative language models as a substitute for direct and factual information retrieval ain&apos;t the one for me.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&apos;s why that&apos;s untrue.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ooh, edgy title! But let me back up my &lt;em&gt;lukewarm&lt;/em&gt; take (heh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re told that &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/ai/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; is simultaneously the present and the future and you&apos;ll be a husk of a human being if you don&apos;t just embrace it and get on the train. Of course, this is absolute nonsense fueled by hypercapitalism but that doesn&apos;t make it any less convincing to &quot;experts&quot; and companies looking for more profit and less outlay (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html&quot;&gt;tech layoffs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this ideology is the implication that whatever you&apos;re doing now is outdated because we said so and regardless of whether it works. Writers aren&apos;t any less qualified or effective than they were in 2019 or before. So why is this burgeoning technology suddenly an answer to a problem that never really existed? Except there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a problem: companies need to recoup the money they lost during the pandemic, and what better way to do that than to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pay employees who need pay rises and instead completely replace them with language models they can tinker with at the fraction of the price. If those writers are lucky, they might stay on but have an increased workload (for no extra pay) involving editing &amp;lt;abbr title=&quot;large language model&quot;&amp;gt;LLM&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt; outputs rather than writing copy from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s the situation we&apos;re in and will continue to be in while AI is seen as the first port of call to any kind of problem. By taking a step back, you can see the wider picture and realise that there are a multitude of options that come &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; opting for AI. Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself truthfully if there&apos;s even a problem to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay your damn people and let them work if there is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider a programmatic approach where applicable (this comes with similar caveats to AI use so don&apos;t fall down a similar trap)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I object/subject!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this is to say &quot;don&apos;t even THINK about AI&quot;—I&apos;m not a conservative—but instead think before you leap into something that could cause harm, and arguably is already. Testing stuff is cool and recommended. That&apos;s why I built Oapy with a mirror of OpenAI&apos;s Playground tool. Give this &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/prompt-engineering/&quot;&gt;prompt engineering&lt;/a&gt; thing a go, read up on how it really works, and see what sticks and what doesn&apos;t. A great article I read a few weeks ago by Mitchell Hashimoto called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-transactional-prompting&quot;&gt;Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting
&lt;/a&gt; touches on the objective and subjective nature of prompt design and where our LLM use cases fall. I&apos;d found issues with using LLMs for generative purposes despite using all the techniques I&apos;d found from language tech professionals. But Mitchell suggests that these use cases fall in the subjective category and that makes them hard to test for accuracy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have an input that can produce an objectively correct (or I&apos;d even argue &quot;mostly correct&quot;) output, then prompt engineering can be successfully applied. Examples of problems with objectively correct results: information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation, etc.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
However, if we have an input that produces something subjectively correct, then prompt engineering is much less useful. The best example of subjective results are creative tasks such as art generation, writing, semantic search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people will—and should—argue that prompt engineering has helped improve creative tasks. But that also, arguably, requires the practioner to have a good understanding of their niche. A very good artist or writer with enough knowledge of what they want and how to achieve it via prompt engineering will get the results they need. It won&apos;t need testing either as they&apos;ll just know based on experience. But someone looking to cut costs and maximise profit will assume you say some magic words and press a button and it&apos;ll just happen because the AI bros said so and they&apos;re never wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cases where AI could be better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main argument for AI as a last resort is stronger for those subjective channels of generation. However, with the objective channels such as &quot;information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation etc.&quot; (ie. most NLP problems) AI can go further up the pecking order. That&apos;s because tools for these tasks have existed for years and have shown varying levels of success. If they work for you, perhaps you don&apos;t need to consider AI at all. But if you need improvements or can&apos;t afford to pay for these tools (a better cost-cutting measure than firing writers I&apos;d say), AI would be a good consideration. That&apos;s because language models in particular are very good at solving NLP problems, with minimal training or supervision. For example, my &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/introducing-ralts/&quot;&gt;RALTS classification tool&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9&quot;&gt;DistilBart-MNLI&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning&quot;&gt;zero-shot learning&lt;/a&gt; and the results have been good enough that I&apos;d never want to fine-tune it. Here&apos;s how it classified this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great article I found a while back titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-language-model-for-your-nlp-use-case-1288ef3c4929&quot;&gt;&quot;Choosing the right language model for your NLP use case&quot;&lt;/a&gt; showed the efficacy of various models (as of September 2022). Some were very good at the aforementioned objective NLP tasks and not so good with content generation, and vice versa. We obviously have ChatGPT and GPT-4 now, as well as a growing number of open source models built of those commercial models, and those gaps are getting smaller by the day. But there isn&apos;t truly a one-size-fits-all model yet and, despite what anyone is telling you, we are no closer to AGI and I don&apos;t think we ever will be so stop talking about it, okay?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being conscious with my conscience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been the main guy at work when it comes to AI. I talk about it a lot, I try to show the best use cases, I&apos;ve even done a webinar on it. But I also show the potential risks and harms of the tech as well because it&apos;s not all interesting and amazing. I worry that the former will outweigh the latter in people&apos;s perceptions and I&apos;ll be the one responsible. That could be unfounded but who am I to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worry I come off as a hypocrite. I do believe there should be some kind of pause and some kind of regulation but I don&apos;t agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; that likes of Gary Marcus and Elon Musk signed &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; Musk was involved, which despite Marcus&apos;s claims should be scrutinised given his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done&quot;&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23687440/elon-musk-truthgpt-ai-chatgpt&quot;&gt;intentions&lt;/a&gt;; this isn&apos;t a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-worst-person-you-know-just-made-a-gr-1825121606/&quot;&gt;The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point&lt;/a&gt; moment). I also worry that a regulatory committee will be whitewashed and cause further harm to the women in AI who have been advocating for better ethics for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have any concrete answers to the problems I see in AI but I do know that I want people to be safe. I don&apos;t feel like we&apos;re getting any safer with this tech in its current state and with what we&apos;re told it can, should, is, and will be used for. AI should be the last resort, not the protection of our lives and where we live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been wanting to write this for months but been afraid of what (neurotypical) people might say. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m ashamed of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent&quot;&gt;neurodivergence&lt;/a&gt; (ND) but rather the fact that I&apos;m self-diagnosing and people LOVE to say &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did I get here? Well, seeing as a professional diagnosis would either involve a 2-year+ wait on the NHS or a 1–2 year wait if I went private and cost me about £2,000, I decided to do some online tests. Before you say anything, I know these aren&apos;t any kind of &quot;proof&quot; but they&apos;re good indicators and I did three of them to get a better overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scores all came out high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;42 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://embrace-autism.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/&quot;&gt;AQ test&lt;/a&gt; (threshold is 26)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;129 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/&quot;&gt;RAADS–R test&lt;/a&gt; (threshold is 65)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;138 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://embrace-autism.com/cat-q/&quot;&gt;CAT-Q test&lt;/a&gt; (threshold is 100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://embrace-autism.com/rbq-2a/&quot;&gt;RBQ-2A test&lt;/a&gt; (threshold is 26; 36 is the average autistic score)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 tests above the threshold has to count for something, right? I&apos;ll speak to a doctor eventually but my circumstances will be changing soon so I&apos;ll need to register with a new surgery to the one I&apos;m at now. When things are settled, I&apos;ll do that. In the meantime, I&apos;m self-diagnosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of why I&apos;m saying &quot;probably&quot; autistic... it&apos;s because I&apos;d feel more comfortable with an official diagnosis. I know I definitely fall into the neurodivergent category; nothing typical about me on that front! I&apos;m still navigating all of these thoughts and feelings, piecing together years of wondering what was &quot;wrong&quot; with me or why people said certain things about me and whether they were true. But the autistic traits I&apos;ve been reading about have definitely answered some life long questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides declaring all this, I also wanted to write out something pointers for people who read this and ever interact with me. Because I&apos;m ND, I don&apos;t engage with people or things in the same way and as I would respect other people&apos;s way of being, I want the same for me. So here&apos;s a list of things (&lt;a href=&quot;/lists/&quot;&gt;because I love lists, duh!&lt;/a&gt;) about me which I&apos;ll update as an when I remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. I get overwhelmed easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is gotten really bad lately. Multi-tasking is not my thing, which means working in an agency across multiple accounts is difficult at times. I try my best to plan things out but I also just want to get things done. Here, I&apos;d say if you ever need something from me, it&apos;s best to ask if I&apos;m available, be super clear on what you want, and when you want it and do it all within the first request. Vague openers usually give me anxiety and I might feel pressure to commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. I don&apos;t like small talk or &quot;networking&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll do small talk with my mum because it&apos;s safe and easy. I can&apos;t do it with strangers because I have no idea what people really think or feel when talking to me, and I&apos;ve had comments based on my appearance from the get-go (gotta love casual racism). That&apos;s not to say I want deep, meaningful conversations immediately—or ever—but the truth is I get nervous when I have to talk to people. I feel like I waffle and that I&apos;m putting on an act, as if I&apos;m pretending to be a &quot;normal&quot; human being. I used to be better in like 2019 but it&apos;s gotten worse since the pandemic (understandable trust issues!!!) and my social anxiety is at an all-time high. I have nothing to recommend here. It&apos;s a social &quot;thing&quot; to have icebreakers and group work and small talk and I don&apos;t see that ever stopping, even if there are probably tests showing they don&apos;t work as well. But if you have an opportunity to not do those things and accommodate for ND people, do it. Because that&apos;s the inclusive part of &quot;diversity and inclusion&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. My short term memory sucks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when you go into a room and forget why you&apos;re there? Well, imagine that but it&apos;s pretty much every time you go into a room. I have to sometimes say what I&apos;m there for over and over in my head like a Buddhist chant. I get distracted more than ever before and, while I think I can return my focus to the thing I was meant to do, it doesn&apos;t always happen. I hate it. And I&apos;ve already forgotten what the next part should be while writing this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. I prefer to work alone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the things you&apos;ve ever see me create? 99.9% of it was done alone. I don&apos;t like to rely on people too much as I appreciate we all have lives to live and can&apos;t definitely commit. That means if I know I need something and I can do it myself, I will. And so I work alone and find a way where I can. Working with one other person works for me but whole groups with multiple voices? I&apos;m not good at it and I don&apos;t feel like I should assimilate because &quot;that&apos;s just how it&apos;s done&quot;. Reject tradition; embrace chaos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. I need detailed explanations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve had to learn how to read between the lines when people ask me to do things or tell me stuff. But it&apos;s very tiring and I don&apos;t always get what people are trying to say. So I need detailed explanations if you want me to do something for you. Vagueness confuses me or will lead me to try a method that takes more time than I should spend on the task. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean hand-holding but I tend to get flustered if I go down a path and get told that I&apos;m doing it wrong or &quot;why are you doing it that way?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. I hyperfocus a lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love learning, especially if I find something cool. But that can lead to hyperfocusing, which means I&apos;ll hone in on something and spend hours getting into it. Building this website is an example of that. I spent hours over weeks in 2021 putting this site together and learning Astro. Same goes for Neo4j and graph science. And Python. Even Pokémon back when I was young (although that&apos;s probably not indicative to autism as it&apos;s Pokémon after all lol). Hyperfocusing has lead me to build knowledge in a lot of areas but the downside is creating time sinks where I could be doing literally anything else. Like resting. Less sleep is not good, no matter what people tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Too much noise gives me sensory overload&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like my peace and quiet a lot of the time. So when I&apos;m in a shopping centre or at work or even at home where my son watches TV at a loud volume and then plays on his Switch at near full volume, it gets too much. It&apos;s why I often have headphones in as a way to regulate the sounds I hear. Sensory overload often turns into irritability so if you catch me in that funk, give me a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;if you have any comments about this, for yourself, and we know each other, feel free to talk to me. If you have any criticisms, keep them to yourself. If you have any advice, ask me whether I&apos;m open to this first. I don&apos;t like unsolicited advice as it often comes from a different life experience to mine and the rapport is almost never established beforehand so it sounds like someone offering a smile, a biscuit, and a cup of tea for mental health issues. I&apos;ve been accused of being standoffish and aloof many times before when I&apos;ve actually been struggling and nobody thought to check in first. Don&apos;t be that person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to create a page to &lt;a href=&quot;/lastfm-top-1000/&quot;&gt;display my Last.fm top 1000 artists&lt;/a&gt;. Here&apos;s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Get the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this data, you need the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/api&quot;&gt;Last.fm API&lt;/a&gt; and an account. With my credentials, I wrote a script that scraped the data and created a JSON file out of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import requests
import json
import datetime

payload = {
  &apos;api_key&apos;: API_KEY,
  &apos;format&apos;: &apos;json&apos;,
  &apos;limit&apos;: 1000,
}

r = requests.get(&apos;https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.gettopartists&amp;amp;user=USERNAME&apos;, params=payload)

res = r.json()

for key in range(0,len(res[&apos;topartists&apos;][&apos;artist&apos;])):
    
    # Change playCount from str to int
    res[&apos;topartists&apos;][&apos;artist&apos;][key][&apos;playcount&apos;] = int(res[&apos;topartists&apos;][&apos;artist&apos;][key][&apos;playcount&apos;])

    res[&apos;last updated&apos;] = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(&apos;%d %B %Y&apos;)

with open(&apos;../data/lastfm.json&apos;, &quot;w+&quot;) as f:
    json.dump(res, f, indent=4)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This created a &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;lastfm.json&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; file. I also included a key for the date when I update the file so I can display that on the page. Now there&apos;s time to use the Fetch API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Fetch the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the Fetch API for my wiki pages to pull data from my other WordPress blogs via the REST API. In this case, I&apos;m pulling from a local JSON file so I start by importing the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import lastfm from &apos;../data/lastfm.json&apos;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I use .map() to map the rank, artist, and playcount to a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last updated: {lastfm[&apos;last updated&apos;]}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Pos.&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Artist&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Playcount&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;
  {lastfm.topartists.artist.map((item) =&amp;gt; (
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{item[&apos;@attr&apos;].rank}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href={item.url}&amp;gt;{item.name}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{item.playcount.toLocaleString()}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
  ))}
  &amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to note: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;lastfm.topartists.artist.map&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; gets all the artist data and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;item.playcount.toLocaleString()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; converts the playcount and adds a thousands comma seperator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s it. If you have any questions, email me or tweet me.&lt;/p&gt;

I knew to take that 90% stat with a pinch of salt, regarless of the asterisk, but wanted to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my prompt, I tried something I&apos;ve been using on GPT3.5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;prompt-box&quot;&amp;gt;Write a four-sentence blog post about the hundred dollar bill in the style of [name redacted].&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;output-box&quot;&amp;gt;The hundred dollar bill is a denomination of United States currency. It features a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and an eagle flying over a rocky shore on the reverse. In recent years, the hundred dollar bill has become increasingly popular as a medium of exchange, particularly in the underground economy and in online transactions. Despite its widespread use, the hundred dollar bill remains a symbol of wealth and prestige, and is often associated with luxury and success.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds believable... but it&apos;s not all true. There isn&apos;t a flying eagle nor a rocky shore on the back. The rest is generic and subjective. It certainly wasn&apos;t in the style of the redacted person I used. But I didn&apos;t expect perfection or 100% truth (and neither should you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to test the chatbot element. I then prompted Vicuna to reword the previous output &quot;in the style of Don King&quot;. I wanted something ostentatious and my mind went to Don King as I&apos;ve used boxing related prompts in previous examples. Here&apos;s the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;output-box&quot;&amp;gt;Yo, what&apos;s good people! Let me tell you about the hundred dollar bill. It&apos;s a big deal, ya hear me? This piece of paper with Benny Franklin&apos;s mug on it is what&apos;s up, Tinseltown! It&apos;s got the power to make your dreams come true, or at least get you some fancy threads and a fancy car. But don&apos;t get it twisted, this bill is not just for the rich and famous, it&apos;s for anyone who&apos;s got the hustle and the flow. So if you&apos;re looking to make some serious cash, don&apos;t sleep on the hundred dollar bill, baby!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out. Standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; bad caricature of Don King but it made me laugh &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it was so bad. I could see a crap (probably white, almost certainly cis male) comedian try this and flop. If there&apos;s one profession I&apos;d like to see put out of business because of AI, it&apos;s that (I jest; AI is still as prone to racist as white male comedians given they both get their &apos;humour&apos; from Reddit anyway, but I digress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More on Vicuna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/&quot;&gt;Vicuna published a full breakdown of the model&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;s advantages, and disadvantages. The tl;dr: it&apos;s a good open-source alternative but it could never be as good as Bard/any GPT model. Unfortunately, the dataset isn&apos;t available and there are no plans to release it which is a shame and undermines the open-sourceness of it a little, but it might also be a legal thing; I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used it to try and find a link between two randomly selected tags from my blogs. I got &apos;bell hooks&apos; and &apos;Tony Hawk&apos; and this is what it said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;prompt-box&quot;&amp;gt;Give me an entity that links bell hooks and Tony Hawk&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=&quot;output-box&quot;&amp;gt;It is not immediately clear what connection, if any, exists between bell hooks and Tony Hawk. bell hooks is an American author, feminist, and social activist, known for her
critical race theory and gender studies. She is a professor at the City University of New York and has written many books on topics such as race, gender, and sexuality. Tony
Hawk, on the other hand, is an American professional skateboarder, actor, and television personality, known for his career in skateboarding and his appearances on
television shows such as &quot;The Tony Hawk Show&quot; and &quot;Proving Ground&quot;. It is not clear how these two individuals would be linked, as their areas of expertise and interests
seem to be quite different.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coherent and fairly true. I wouldn&apos;t have expected an open-source model to find a deeper connection than I would have found besides them both being American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and jewelry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;output-box&quot;&amp;gt;One possible entity that links jewelry and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the character April O&apos;Neil, who is a human character in the TMNT franchise and is often depicted wearing jewelry. April is a journalist who becomes the turtles&apos; ally and friend, and she is often shown wearing various types of jewelry, such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. The turtles themselves are also sometimes shown wearing jewelry, such as necklaces or headbands, particularly in the early cartoon series. In addition, there are many pieces of TMNT-themed jewelry that have been created for fans of the franchise, such as rings, pendants, and charm bracelets featuring the turtles and other characters from the series.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, plausible. The last part in particular inspired me to find this piece of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk/check-out-this-iced-tmnt-pendant/&quot;&gt;TMNT-themed jewelry&lt;/a&gt; which I blogged about. And that&apos;s the beauty of this tech. To paraphrase Joe MacMillan from Halt and Catch Fire, &quot;AI isn&apos;t the thing; it&apos;s the thing that gets you to the thing.&quot; AI can&apos;t give me a finished product but it can certainly help me get there, alongside my ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the very first prompt + output, hallucinations are still a big flaw and it gets bigger with open source models created from better closed-source models. The idea is to take what&apos;s there and refine and pre-train it on high quality training data to perform specific tasks. That&apos;s where this tech excels. Where you&apos;ll find outliers and inconsistent performance is trying to turn this proverbial black box into a Tower of Babel but that isn&apos;t stopping every AI startup from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried another pair of entities to see how they were linked (Martin Luther King and Cuba) and the model&apos;s output said MLK had visited Cuba in 1960. That didn&apos;t happen. These things aren&apos;t great for factual information, even when you hook them up to the internet—you know, that completely factual and never wrong platform of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;List of slogans&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1963 - Things Go Better with Coke&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1969 - It&apos;s the Real Thing &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1971 - I&apos;d Like to Buy the World a Coke (part of the &quot;It&apos;s the Real Thing&quot; campaign)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1975 - Look Up America&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1976 - Coke Adds Life &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1979 - Have a Coke and a Smile&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1982 - Coke Is It! &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1985 - We&apos;ve Got a Taste for You (for both Coca-Cola &amp;amp; Coca-Cola classic)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1985 - America&apos;s Real Choice (for both Coca-Cola &amp;amp; Coca-Cola classic)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1986 - Red, White &amp;amp; You (for Coca-Cola classic)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1986 - Catch the Wave (for Coca-Cola)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1987 - When Coca-Cola is a Part of Your Life, You Can&apos;t Beat the Feeling&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1988 - You Can&apos;t Beat the Feeling &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1989 - Official Soft Drink of Summer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1990 - You Can&apos;t Beat the Real Thing&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1993 - Always Coca-Cola&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2000 - Coca-Cola. Enjoy&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2001 - Life Tastes Good&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2009 - Open Happiness&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2016 - Taste the Feeling&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 - Real Magic&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that got me thinking... what would GPT-3.5 create based on those examples? So I put it in using a private &quot;lite&quot; version of &lt;a href=&quot;/morsels/morsel-9/&quot;&gt;Oapy&lt;/a&gt; with the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Create 10 more Coca-Cola slogans based on the following examples and following the format: [THE ABOVE LIST WENT HERE]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also gave it a headstart and appended the prompt with &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;2023 - &amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2023 - Discover the Magic of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2025 - Refresh Your World with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2027 - Share the Happiness with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2030 - The Real Taste of Life: Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2032 - The Magic is in the Bottle: Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2035 - Coca-Cola: The Ultimate Refreshment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2040 - Experience the Magic of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2042 - Always Real, Always Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2045 - Taste the Magic of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2050 - Unlock the Magic of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little stilted. I think the latter slogans influenced the output with its use of the brand name, resulting in lifeless results. Let&apos;s try with just slogans from the 21st century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2023 - Refresh Your World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2025 - Experience the Joy of Coke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2027 - Spark Happiness with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2028 - Unleash the Magic of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2030 - Enjoy the Authentic Taste of Coke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2032 - Savor the Moment with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2034 - Real Moments, Real Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2036 - Experience Coke, Experience Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2038 - Share the Love with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2040 - The Real Refreshment You Need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the 80s to 90s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshment in Every Sip (for Coca-Cola classic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taste the Difference with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coca-Cola: The Classic Choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisfy Your Thirst with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Perfect Drink for Any Occasion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy Coca-Cola, Enjoy Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Taste of Happiness with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quench Your Thirst with Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coca-Cola: A Timeless Classic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience the Flavor of Coca-Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the years weren&apos;t used in this, possibly because 2023 was a large jump from 1993. Either way... it didn&apos;t make much difference. I&apos;m not prompt engineer so maybe someone else can get better results based on this example of few-shot learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we must remember that unrefined language models outputs are not production-ready. If you&apos;re using them for generative tasks, you iterate and refine until you get what you need. If I remove the mentions of Coca-Cola from the last version, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshment in Every Sip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taste the Difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Classic Choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisfy Your Thirst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Perfect Drink for Any Occasion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy Coca-Cola, Enjoy Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Taste of Happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quench Your Thirst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Timeless Classic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience the Flavor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes, they&apos;re even worse without the brand name and some are already taken (Tesco uses Taste the Difference and Satisfy/Quench Your Thirst are close to Sprite&apos;s Obey Your Thirst, which the Coca-Cola Company owns but you don&apos;t want to mix things up like that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we still have brand consultants and agencies, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Another word for machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of [insert functioning discipline here that requires human labour]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any kind of magic or mystical power we will never find out about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that can—and will—revolutionise anything and everything you can think of by sheer force and will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something to ignore the effects of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t that I know more than you and I’m blasting it in your face. “HERE, ALLOW ME TO BLAST MY EXPERTISE IN YOUR FACE”. No, instead it’s saying “Hey, here’s something I find interesting and it made me think of you”.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
You’re not writing from a place of authority, you’re writing from a place of curiosity. Open writing, not closed writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to do that as much as I can both on &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/&quot;&gt;my blogs&lt;/a&gt; and on social media. There are some things I&apos;m very passionate about and convey as much authority I have without pretending that I have more. Sometimes, people miscontrue that as a higher level of expertise but I can&apos;t control their opinions. But I mostly shitpost and talk about my thoughts out loud. I ask questions; the kind that people &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be asking but don&apos;t. And I think critical thinking is crucial now, more than ever. We have the power and often pretend like the power has already been lost (and people LOVE to tell you *insert doomsday prediction* is already here!&quot; and offer no further context about what any of that means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll write a thread of consciousness or I&apos;ll write a single, throwaway comment. But I&apos;ll keep it moving. Unless it involves scale (because you still don&apos;t understand it).&lt;/p&gt;

These are bare minimum requirements for every human on the planet. Just because someone is LGBTQ+ or disabled or part of any combination of marginalised groups doesn&apos;t mean you need to collect data and create a report to tell you... discrimination exists and people feel excluded. And that&apos;s all these reports really do. If you&apos;re lucky to get actions from them, they&apos;re devoid of communication with these groups and suggest things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing words in documents without context as to why or any consultation with those affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating groups that segregate more than they include (for what it&apos;s worth, I do think Black-specific communities, for example, are a vital thing in societies but they should be uplifted and protected by people outside them too and the fact that they&apos;re not is where this point stems from)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconscious bias training that focuses on one subset of people and barely shakes the proverbial table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could just look inward, do your reading, call out discrimination, check in with people at any time and not just during times of grief, provide assistance to those who need it, ask what people need, listen and don&apos;t offer advice unless you&apos;re asked for it, and not make things about you and your data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not data points. We are people. Treat us with respect NOW and stop hiding behind pie charts and bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garrettsussman_at-least-50-of-people-dont-care-that-tools-activity-7041768961473925121-lIXj&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 50% of people don&apos;t care that tools like ChatGPT or Bing&apos;s Sydney produce factually inaccurate answers.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
If we&apos;ve learned anything from the world of social media and conspiracy theory culture, people will accept an answer that&apos;s delivered with confidence.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
These tools are large language models, not knowledge models.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I can understand why Google has been apprehensive to roll them out into their search product.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Unfortunately, in a capitalist society, money trumps ethics too often.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
AI-generated content will flood the internet. And I don&apos;t think you can count on Google to fact-check for you. Just look at YouTube&apos;s suggestion algorithms.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
All that said, I still believe that AI-generated content can be a useful tool, but the best content creators will still have the workflows in place, build credibility (E-E-A-T), and use it ethically.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
What say you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which my responses were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreed, and as an industry we should do more to give balanced approaches like this and highlight the potentially harmful aspects with as much weight as we give to all the &quot;interesting&quot; use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (in reference to whether the good will outweigh the bad for large language models):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the hands that this tech is in currently (the ones with the most power) will tip the scales towards the bad. I&apos;m not trusting of major world leaders and their governments in any case but there needs to be SOMETHING in place and it needs to involve not just the CEOs of these AI companies and their biggest investors but with non-C-suite practitioners too (with as little bias as possible to avoid poisoning the well further). Any loopholes and it&apos;ll get worse.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I also think that in our industry, we cannot ignore any of that because it is all intricately linked. Without people and search engines, SEO has very little to go on (if anything, arguably but that&apos;s another story for another day lol). So it&apos;s up to us to be as open, transparent, and balanced as possible with a people-first approach to everything—as it should always be, regardless of this emergent technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 8 things I&apos;ve picked up over that period.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the fourth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/first-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;read about my first year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/second-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;my second year&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/third-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;my third year&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&apos;ve learnt in my fourth year as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. SEOs still love experts, even when they pass off second-hand information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still get called an &quot;expert&quot; in things. I&apos;m still grateful for the recognition in my field. I still don&apos;t personally own that accolade. Many others still do despite primarily passing off second-hand information from experts outside &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/seo/&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; (I&apos;m referring to &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/ai/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want someone who knows their stuff in a different field, talk to someone in that field. Read papers, watch videos, attend conferences. Don&apos;t follow the sole advice of a &quot;SEO guru&quot; (eww, David!), and especially one that doesn&apos;t expand on the key areas of interest (such as biases and harms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. John Mueller remains the MVP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, if you&apos;re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year. And the years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science continue to grow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three disciplines have enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined. I have used them all fairly regularly in my professional work over the last year and they&apos;ve given me incredible insights and saved a lot of time. My next step is to standardise some of my approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Python still rocks and I&apos;m back in the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d taken a bit of a break last year and the year before due to mental health but I&apos;m back on the Python train and creating a whole load of techniques and scripts. You can see some of them on my Morsels page above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. I love web performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Web Vitals was always a bit of a stumbling block for me. Because of how it was portrayed in the industry, it felt like a necessity and could only be done one way. But having done &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many audits in the last year, I&apos;ve grown to understand what matters and what doesn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will say this: synthetic data (aka lab data) and RUM data (aka field data) have their places in web performance and it&apos;s important to look at both when making changes because iPhone 14 users on 5G in the UK and US aren&apos;t the only people on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Please stop using AI for bad things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: will this cause harm to someone or a group of people in some way? Am I taking work away from someone who needs it? If the answer is yes, don&apos;t use AI for that thing. People should always come first in making these decicions and even if you do use AI for a task, people must be involved at every single stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of AI use we see today involves some kind of model, underpinned by probabilities of the &quot;right&quot; output and put into the world with a healthy dose of confirmation bias (ie. well, I don&apos;t know how it got to that answer but this machine gave me something human-like so it must be okay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallucinations can and do cause harm. Stop it. Get some (human) help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. It&apos;s okay to not be okay, except all the times when it isn&apos;t&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened to me recently that shook me for a few days. It reminded me why I never used to open up to people or let myself be vulnerable and it comes down to how people throw slogans and platitudes in times of notable grief (e.g. when someone famous dies or there is a major world event) but when the dust settles, it&apos;s back to the same old lines—&lt;em&gt;don&apos;t do that, it makes me uncomfortable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I won&apos;t go back in my shell. When I&apos;m not okay, people who need to know will know. And those who don&apos;t because of how I&apos;ve seen them act when people around the struggle won&apos;t get my grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. The industry still isn&apos;t great and AI is gonna make it worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egos are still rampant in SEO but now that we have AI, I feel like it&apos;s going to get worse. &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/prompt-engineering/&quot;&gt;Prompt engineering&lt;/a&gt; is the latest craze that [I&apos;d previously tweeted about as a close analogue to Facebook&apos;s video pivot controversy. We still don&apos;t know why these prompts work in the way they do but damned if someone with an expert complex is gonna be honest about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemme just say to be careful whose words you follow as gospel. And read papers by language tech pros and ask them questions instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shout outs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sophie Logan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sophie Darr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sophie Gibson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jess Peck&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clarissa Ankrah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucky Acan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olivia-Mae Foong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucy Robinson&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And loads of other people I&apos;ve not mentioned who have made my fourth year as an SEO a great one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompt engineering is a technique or discipline in AI where the prompt (what you ask a model to do) contains a description of the task you want it to complete. That part is fine and features all the advantages of single/few shot learning. Great. But the rhetoric around it is full of hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt Engineering And Why It Matters To The AI Revolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &apos;Prompt Engineering&apos; the Future of AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt Engineering: The Career of Future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of blogging and rise of the prompt engineer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think AI and data science have bigger problems to solve than whether prompt engineering is the way to sustain a career. Again, I have nothing against the concept &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, just how people are claiming its potential makes it a surefire hit for individuals and industries. A lot of the time, I see people making educated guesses and turning them into blog posts about &quot;cool prompt engineering tips&quot;. For people who aren&apos;t directly in the field, that&apos;s all we&apos;re doing. If that&apos;s a hot take, call me Luke Warm. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this discourse reminds me of those marketing &quot;experts&quot; who conduct studies on a handful of websites (1 million out of the 2 billion+ online) and claim that results show what Google uses as ranking factors. The key link is the idea that a governing body of sorts has a black box where all the algorithms live and only the clever few with knowledge in that area can tease answers out of it. Perhaps we&apos;ll see these &quot;gurus&quot; (fwiw, I despite that term and wish people would stop using it unironically) pivot towards prompt engineering to make themselves look relevant and go Super Saiyan Expert 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe we could fix the models and stop pretending like AI models are magicians hats. Okay, that&apos;s the last analogy I&apos;m using. This stuff is already complicated to explain to laypeople as it is (myself included).&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>AI is a lot like an orange</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/ai-is-a-lot-like-an-orange/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/ai-is-a-lot-like-an-orange/</guid><description>There are plenty of analogies for AI but mine is the best.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/ai/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;?&quot; is such a loaded question at the moment and you get a different answer (or none at all) from every person you ask. Well, I&apos;m here to provide yet another and I reckon mine is pretty good (but probably not original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the Simpsons meme above where Homer originally likened marriage to an orange, I think AI has a similar analogy. An orange is made up of its skin and the juicy segments in the middle and without the skin, there&apos;s nothing holding those segments together. I would say the orange, as a whole &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, is AI and the segments within are the various techniques and sub-disciplines that make it up. The skin is the front-facing side that we all see and hear about in the media (and, like AI, I&apos;m sure certain people would argue which orange is the best, which tastes bad, and why oranges are good or bad for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of AI subtopics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning (arguably the most important and often used interchangeably with &quot;AI&quot; which I would personally disagree with)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q-learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supervised learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupervised learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural language processing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topic modelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity extraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuzzy matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to let me know if any of those need rearranging but they all make up what AI is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for computer science, those would be... orange tree grove I guess? The jury&apos;s still out on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

But today, I wondered if that was the right word to describe how I&apos;ve been feeling lately and for a while. Burnout is a &quot;state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress&quot; according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm&quot;&gt;HelpGuide&lt;/a&gt; and probably any qualified professional. The goal is to address it and regain a balance. But what about the long-term effects of that burnout?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you burn anything, it leaves a scar or some visual reminder of its harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I realised perhaps I was just... weather-beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After days, weeks, months, and years of &quot;emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress&quot;, I had my own emotional, physical, and mental scars. I&apos;ve had to weather a lot of personal storms and those traumas have left me as the person I am today. I still have a lot of work to do and I need help with a lot of it too. How and when I&apos;ll get to those are up to me and that annoying thing called &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; but I&apos;m aware of them at least in principle. Falling in love has been both a regenerative force and a reminder of those weather-induced scars and how I need to combat them. But these days, the rain doesn&apos;t bring me down so much.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ve written it in jest and as an experiment--with a little help from OpenAI--to see how Google figures out its context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-cannot-interpret-poems-33968.html&quot;&gt;based on this article about a tweet from John Mueller&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-----&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;A poem about how search engines can&apos;t interpret poems&quot; by Luke Davis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poems are like oceans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowing through the blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines are like ships&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hunt for something new&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they can&apos;t always interpret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twists and turns of a poem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden meanings and symbols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just don&apos;t know &apos;em&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all that is left is a bag of words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That don&apos;t always make sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that&apos;s the poet&apos;s fault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For switching between past and present tense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But search engines try their hardest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those pesky spider bots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To interpret the context of some prose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And connect those linguistic dots&lt;/p&gt;

I was finally in the career I&apos;d fought to get into for the past 8 years, money was alright, I had a partner and I was happy. And then &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/covid-19/&quot;&gt;2020 did its thing&lt;/a&gt; and ran through my life like a wrecking ball. But of all the things that the last couple of years have ruined that upsets me the most, it&apos;s the work on my social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I was very outgoing and had little inhibitions. Confidence was sky high (to the point of arrogance sometimes but being precocious is part of childhood, right?) Then high school changed that. I had friendship group but I always felt... different or &quot;outside&quot;. I was picked on quite a lot in my final year and made a very stupid decision a few years before that for me excluded for a week (I won&apos;t discuss that here). College was my attempt to shrug off my academic prowess for a taste of pseudo-extroversion and it kinda worked for a couple of years, and into uni but then I developed depression. And dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, skip 14 years and in that time, I realised a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That &quot;outsider&quot; feeling was probably the fact that I was neurodivergent without knowing what the hell that was (recently, I took a few online tests that suggested I had &quot;severe&quot; symptoms for autism and while I won&apos;t go into that in this post, that makes more sense to me than anything in the last few years - although I&apos;m not sure about the word &quot;severe&quot; but I digress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was an introvert and still am (I didn&apos;t discover that until 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&apos;t comfortable with who I was and desperately tried to be someone else until the pretence became so exhausting I couldn&apos;t keep it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And only now do I have the self confidence I needed all those years ago. But it feels like it&apos;s come at a cost. I feel more isolated than ever. I don&apos;t feel like I fit in with anyone bar a small group of mostly online friends. Everything about socialising makes me feel uncomfortable, anxious, and skeptical. What do people want from me when I talk to them? Do I need to say lots? Have they judged me already and want me to leave? Do they think I&apos;m weird? Do I make too many weird references? Am I annoying? Do people hate me? Maybe my self confidence isn&apos;t in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it kinda is. I know I&apos;m good at what I do, professionally or with my hobbies. I love the music I make, I&apos;m a very good SEO, and I&apos;m funny. But that doesn&apos;t &quot;get me in&quot; with people, so to speak. Have you ever played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subbuteo.com/&quot;&gt;Subbuteo&lt;/a&gt;? There&apos;s a special contraption you use for a player that takes set pieces and that&apos;s all they do. Or perhaps you know the NFL and special teams? Well, I feel like a kicker. I&apos;m called on for a niche requirement and then... nothing. That&apos;s how I feel, even if it&apos;s not true. But I&apos;d never know if it was real or not because how do you ask for confirmation without sound weird or expecting to get a straight honest answer. And so I live in doubt that anyone I speak to thinks I&apos;m an interesting well-rounded person. I know &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people do because they&apos;ve told me and I feel comfortable being myself around them. Others vary. But the important thing is I try hard not to diminish myself (too much). I mean, I hold back my idiosyncrasies when I fear they&apos;ll be weaponised against me based on prior evidence. But otherwise I&apos;m me. And it&apos;s taken years to accept who I was, which is still a work in progress, in spite of growing social anxiety and fear of what someone will say or do because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not had anyone &quot;call me out&quot; yet and I&apos;ll keep toeing that anxiety line like a nervous trapeze artist over a precarious safety net they sewed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re overwhelmed by all the SEO tips, future trends, Python scripts, automation ideas, folks convinced tech SEO is a waste of time and it&apos;s all about CONTENT and LINKS, or the folks obsessed with talking about dinosaurs for some reason... so am I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides my default SEO advice (get a blog), one thing I&apos;ve learnt to do over the years is to filter out things that aren&apos;t in my control or that I can&apos;t immediately do anything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. I&apos;d like to train a language model but I can&apos;t right now. Automating whole processes I&apos;ve JUST gotten comfortable with isn&apos;t feasible. Adding further complexities like other people&apos;s Google Sheets to my keyword research process will waste time I should be using to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All their respective works are valid, innovative, helpful, and testament to their dedication. But it&apos;s not for us to dig into the moment we see them or we&apos;ll get lost and not be able to do the work we&apos;re supposed to do. We may never use these scripts or tips because we may never need them. It&apos;s all about what works for you and dipping in if it doesn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done but this &quot;lite&quot; version of SEO stoicism (or as I have just christened it for this LinkedIn post &apos;SEOicism&apos;) can reduce the burnout we&apos;re all feeling, in an industry that likes to tell us we&apos;re perennially behind when we aren&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;

It means I can help businesses improve the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt; of their organic visibility but I start to see the Web in a way that doesn&apos;t fit my origins. I can&apos;t always look in wonder because my professional side starts auditing sites. Then I&apos;ve done some &apos;SEO things&apos; on my own sites such as deleting pages that &apos;had little-to-no value&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I culled about 500 posts off one of my blogs a while back and while I saw a benefit (causation ≠ correlation etc. etc.), I realised that was a bad thing for me. Why? Because who am I to say if they had value or not? I&apos;ve been thinking about that a lot lately as I&apos;ve been restoring another site with blog posts via the Wayback Machine. It was originally hacked and taken down for good a few years ago and I had the idea of bringing it back (with permission) and I&apos;ve been slowly bringing the old posts back. It&apos;s been a cathartic experience and I will likely do the same for my other blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t delete your work&quot; is a quote from art director &lt;a href=&quot;https://curvesbyseanbrown.com/&quot;&gt;Sean Brown&lt;/a&gt; and I&apos;m for it (within reason). The addendum of restoration after deletion is also important if it&apos;s possible to do so. After all, I am a self-proclaimed LESSEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a tweet today that said it takes years to get over burnout and I&apos;m into my third year of it. I&apos;m on my hundredth Twitter break. I&apos;m easily overwhelmed by EVERYTHING in &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/seo/&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; right now. There seems to be a million and one ways to do the same things and the million and first is somehow the better version. I seem to get sensory overload a lot easier these days. I&apos;m more irritable than I&apos;ve ever been. I have an appetite for food but none for making it. I&apos;m too tired to do anything extra-curricular other than blog. I constantly feel like I&apos;m running on empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just an FYI (but not an invitation for suggestions on how to fix me.)&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I’ve felt both.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Python. It&apos;s a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I&apos;ve felt both. Sometimes, at the same time. For all its wonderful use cases, quirks, and benefits, it is misunderstood. I&apos;m not here to say it&apos;s the greatest programming language (that&apos;s HTML) but I wanted to talk about Python from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - I&apos;m going to do this in a list format and some of it will be tongue-in-cheek but the summary is: &lt;strong&gt;Python is something that you don&apos;t have to learn if you don&apos;t want to in SEO&lt;/strong&gt;. I can&apos;t stress that enough. This is more of a reassurance than an introduction to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether you want to be the best SEO (that&apos;s an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don&apos;t &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; Python in your career. Learning Python is a choice and should be considered with variability.
1a. You get out of it what you put in but you can get more out than you&apos;d expect. Learning Python&apos;s basic functions can speed up work you may have been doing manually or formulaically in Google Sheets/Excel to the point your computer crashes because you&apos;ve exported a 80,000-row CSV of keywords from Ahrefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started learning Python in October 2019 because I felt extreme FOMO and also inspiration, having seen Ruth Everett do it.
2a. Ruth, if you&apos;re reading this, thank you for inadvertently doing that. It has changed my life and career for the better!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn&apos;t feel like I&apos;d be able to do those things ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn&apos;t understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we&apos;ve all done it so don&apos;t you &lt;strong&gt;dare&lt;/strong&gt; scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/&quot;&gt;the Python course I&apos;d started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don&apos;t but it works so I don&apos;t care (we&apos;ve all done it so don&apos;t you &lt;strong&gt;dare&lt;/strong&gt; scoff!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don&apos;t get on but I tolerate it because I have to. I don&apos;t want to talk about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the SEO community, there are more articles demonstrating intermediate and advanced concepts than there are basics and this is overwhelming for beginners and even intermediate and advanced users.
8a. Because of this, it puts people off from even starting and fuels the ideology that Python is a fad for nerds who don&apos;t care about content and links and then you get people scoffing at it and demanding we focus on content and links and strategy as if those ideas has ever been ignored in the history of SEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/introducing-ralts/&quot;&gt;The script that I wrote about about a week ago&lt;/a&gt; took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it&apos;s still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.
10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don&apos;t neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don&apos;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to but if you&apos;re planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.
10b. Actually, it&apos;s best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don&apos;t work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it&apos;s slow or it won&apos;t get you a job. They&apos;re not that cute, their hair&apos;s uneven, and they look dusty.
14a. Also don&apos;t listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you&apos;ll &quot;fall behind&quot;. There are plenty of &quot;experts&quot; making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn&apos;t recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can&apos;t be &quot;less&quot;. I don&apos;t hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven&apos;t finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don&apos;t always remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren&apos;t relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I&apos;d have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it
16a. Most of what you see probably won&apos;t help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you&apos;ll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it&apos;s unknown to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn it if you think it&apos;s cool and interesting and want to see how it works. It&apos;s absolutely cool if you do little things for yourself and move on. That&apos;s not failure and even if it was, at least you succeeded at trying it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To echo the sentiments of Miracle Inameti-Archibong in her recent Women In Tech SEO talk, play with existing code that&apos;s already out there. You don&apos;t have to create new ones.
18a. From a learning perspective, it might be easier for you to use an existing script, find a fault or improvement, and do that one specific thing. Congrats—you just learnt how to code!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact me (links are on the homepage) if you ever want to chat about Python, my experiences, how to get started, what I&apos;ve used it for, anything. For us to enjoy and grow, we need love, care, and a sense of community. Everyone should be safe with the decisions they make, whether that means learning Python or not. I can&apos;t guarantee it won&apos;t be overwhelming because I still feel that way sometimes. But there are people around to ask for help (including me) and you&apos;re within your rights to take a deep breath, close your laptop and leave it for a day, week, or month until you&apos;re ready to come back. Or just leave it there. There are no obligations other than the ones you set yourself. It&apos;s good to be disciplined with how you learn as it can build structure to learn and grow but that shouldn&apos;t come at the expense of your peace. Python isn&apos;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&apos;ve lost track of this post. Where was I? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HuIILdA8Lg&quot;&gt;Oh, yeah. Stay out of my booze!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 12 things I&apos;ve picked up over that period.</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/first-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;read about my first year here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/second-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;my second year here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&apos;ve learnt in my third year as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Women in SEO are still the best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still hasn&apos;t changed from last year or the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku &amp;amp; Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk&quot;&gt;B-DigitalUK&lt;/a&gt;, Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/&quot;&gt;Crystal Carter&lt;/a&gt;, Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. SEOs really love experts, huh?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things. 1) I&apos;m honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I&apos;m not an expert. That&apos;s okay to say as it isn&apos;t a binary construct of &quot;OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME&quot; on one end and &quot;I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER&quot; on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That&apos;s how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Many at the top don&apos;t really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be writing a follow-up to my piece on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/&quot;&gt;Being Black in Digital Marketing&lt;/a&gt;, looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I&apos;m by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku &amp;amp; Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can&apos;t help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we&apos;re back where we were as a community. I&apos;m neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I&apos;ve had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don&apos;t really want diversity in SEO, don&apos;t know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, if you&apos;re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk/tag/machine-learning/&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/&quot;&gt;natural language processing (NLP)&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence&quot;&gt;AGI or artifical general intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I&apos;d love that one day. Manifesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Python is still amazing and I&apos;m getting back into it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/&quot;&gt;WatSERP script&lt;/a&gt; that I will eventually reupload in the future). &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/introducing-ralts/&quot;&gt;Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. I love Google Search Console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It&apos;s all about that granular data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since moving away from IBM Watson &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II&quot;&gt;for moral reasons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.textrazor.com/&quot;&gt;TextRazor&lt;/a&gt; has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There&apos;s plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. I&apos;m fine with not being good at link building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I&apos;ll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. You shouldn&apos;t &quot;live and breathe marketing&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say &quot;don&apos;t do this&quot; and &quot;you must do that&quot; in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don&apos;t if you don&apos;t. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Outside of work, I&apos;m a LESSEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don&apos;t optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn&apos;t completely unoptimised but not to the point where I&apos;m focusing on ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate. I&apos;m not Bruce Wayne/Batman to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. I love the Web, SEO as a discipline, and a select few people but I really don&apos;t like the industry.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweeted that just over 2 years ago. I&apos;ve alluded to some of the reasons in this post but there&apos;s a lot of nonsense and noise out there that you have to sift through to get to the things that make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shout outs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Here&apos;s a script I wrote that marries the two concepts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they&apos;ve changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I&apos;ve decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn&apos;t sure whether to do it as it&apos;s very niche to me but I&apos;ve taken a step out of my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;ralts&quot;&amp;gt; What is RALTS?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it&apos;s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I&apos;ll explain those all in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I&apos;ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I&apos;m a Pokémon fan. It&apos;s a backronym but it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;why_did_you_make_this&quot;&amp;gt;Why did I make it?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: it aids my blogging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I&apos;m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn&apos;t think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;notes_on_my_coding&quot;&amp;gt;Notes on my coding&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I&apos;ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I&apos;ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven&apos;t finished. You&apos;ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for &quot;stupid code&quot; and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his zero shot demo. He wrote a great piece on &lt;a href=&quot;https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html&quot;&gt;zero shot learning&lt;/a&gt; which you should read if you&apos;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/joeddav/zero-shot-demo&quot;&gt;There&apos;s also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&apos;ve taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I&apos;ve forgotten to credit or if you&apos;d prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;some_definitions&quot;&amp;gt;Some definitions&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, about that original explanation. Let&apos;s look at some definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has &quot;an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories - The term &quot;categories&quot; is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment &amp;gt; animation; health &amp;gt; hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance &amp;gt; media &amp;gt; advertising&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They&apos;re basically like tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;tech_requirements&quot;&amp;gt;Tech requirements&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the following Python packages used in the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;streamlit&amp;gt;=1.0.0
pandas&amp;gt;=1.2.3
transformers&amp;gt;=4.12.3
requests&amp;gt;=2.25.1
bs4&amp;gt;=0.0.1
plotly&amp;gt;=5.4.0
numpy&amp;gt;=1.18.0
textrazor==1.4.0
tensorflow&amp;gt;=2.7.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt; for the UI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; for data manipulation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines&quot;&gt;Transformers&lt;/a&gt; for the language model, requests and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; for web scraping, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/&quot;&gt;plotly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://numpy.org/&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; for data viz, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.textrazor.com/&quot;&gt;TextRazor&lt;/a&gt; for the entities and such, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; for the language model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding TensorFlow, the language model I&apos;m using is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9&quot;&gt;DistilBart-MNLI&lt;/a&gt; and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;the_code&quot;&amp;gt;The code&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is split into different parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. TextRazor API key and client details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# TextRazor details
textrazor.api_key = API_KEY

client = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=[&quot;entities&quot;, &quot;topics&quot;])
client.set_classifiers([&quot;textrazor_newscodes&quot;])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to &lt;code&gt;textrazor_newscodes&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.textrazor.com/classification&quot;&gt;Find out more on TextRazor&apos;s Classification page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Load model
@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
def load_model():
  return pipeline(&quot;zero-shot-classification&quot;, 
  model=&apos;valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9&apos;, 
  multi_label=True)

# Classification function
def classify(sequences, candidate_labels):
  output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,
    candidate_labels=candidate_labels)
  return output_results[&apos;labels&apos;], output_results[&apos;scores&apos;]

# Graph plot function
def plot_result(top_topics, scores):
  top_topics = np.array(top_topics)
  scores = np.array(scores)
  scores *= 100
  fig = px.bar(x=scores, 
    y=top_topics,
    orientation=&apos;h&apos;, 
    labels={&apos;x&apos;: &apos;Confidence&apos;, &apos;y&apos;: &apos;Label&apos;},
    text=scores,
    range_x=(0,115),
    title=&apos;Top Predictions&apos;,
    color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),
    color_continuous_scale=&apos;GnBu&apos;)
  fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)
  fig.update_traces(texttemplate=&apos;%{text:0.1f}%&apos;,
  textposition=&apos;outside&apos;)
  st.plotly_chart(fig)

def req(url):
  resp = requests.get(url)
  soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, &apos;html.parser&apos;)
  if soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, id=&quot;comments&quot;) or soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, id=&quot;secondary&quot;):
    remove_comments = soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, id=&quot;comments&quot;)
    remove_comments.extract()
    remove_secondary = soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, id=&quot;secondary&quot;)
    remove_secondary.extract()
    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all([&apos;h1&apos;, &apos;p&apos;])]
    paragraphs = &apos; &apos;.join(ext_t)
    return paragraphs
  else:
    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all([&apos;h1&apos;, &apos;p&apos;])]
    paragraphs = &apos; &apos;.join(ext_t)
    return paragraphs

# Main function
def main():
  with st.spinner(&apos;Classifying...&apos;):
    global txt
    df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)
    df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(
      by=&apos;Relevance Score&apos;, ascending=False)
    classify_topic_score = list(
      df_classify_topic[&apos;Topic&apos;][:10])
    if input_type == &apos;Text&apos;:
      top_topics, scores = classify(
        txt, classify_topic_score)
    elif input_type == &apos;URL&apos;:
      txt = req(url)
      top_topics, scores = classify(
        txt, classify_topic_score)
    elif input_type == &apos;Multiple URLs&apos;:
      txt = &apos; &apos;.join(all_txt)
      top_topics, scores = classify(
        txt, classify_topic_score)

  plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a lot here so I&apos;ll break it down further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn&apos;t reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s how the model classified this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604&quot;&gt;thanks to Jess for the help with that&lt;/a&gt;) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Dictionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kw_dict = {
  &apos;Keyword&apos;: []
}

ent_dict = {
  &apos;Keyword&apos;: [],
  &apos;Relevance Score&apos;: [],
  &apos;Existing Tag&apos;: []
}

topics_dict = {
  &apos;Topic&apos;: [],
  &apos;Relevance Score&apos;: [],
  &apos;Existing Tag&apos;: []
}

categories_dict = {
  &apos;Category&apos;: [],
  &apos;Relevance Score&apos;: []
}

tags = {
  &apos;Tag&apos;: [],
  &apos;ID&apos;: [],
  &apos;Count&apos;: []
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Blog list
blogs = [&apos;sampleface.co.uk&apos;,
	&apos;cultrface.co.uk&apos;,
	&apos;logicface.co.uk&apos;,
	&apos;playrface.co.uk&apos;,
	&apos;distantarcade.co.uk&apos;]

# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs
existing_tags = []
all_txt = []

# Upper limits for tag page range
upper_limits = {
  &apos;sampleface.co.uk&apos;: 4,
  &apos;cultrface.co.uk&apos;: 4,
  &apos;logicface.co.uk&apos;: 2,
  &apos;playrface.co.uk&apos;: 2,
  &apos;distantarcade.co.uk&apos;: 2,
  &apos;ld89.org&apos;: 1
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tag data comes from WordPress&apos;s REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Streamlit UI stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Streamlit stuff

st.sidebar.title(&apos;Tag suggester&apos;)

input_type = st.sidebar.radio(
	&apos;Select your input type&apos;,
	[&apos;Text&apos;, &apos;URL&apos;, &apos;Multiple URLs&apos;])

update_tags = st.sidebar.button(&apos;↻ Refresh tags&apos;)

tag_ideas = st.sidebar.button(&apos;Load tag ideas&apos;)


# Determines input types
st.title(&apos;Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!&apos;)
st.write(&apos;This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).&apos;)
if input_type == &apos;Text&apos;:
  txt = st.text_area(&apos;Enter text to be analysed...&apos;)
  txt = txt.replace(&apos;\n&apos;, &apos; &apos;).replace(&apos;&quot;&apos;, &apos;&apos;).replace(&apos;“&apos;,&apos;&apos;).replace(&apos;”&apos;, &apos;&apos;).replace(&apos;‘&apos;,&apos;&apos;).replace(&apos;’&apos;, &apos;&apos;).replace(&quot;&apos;s&quot;, &apos;&apos;).replace(&quot;,&quot;, &apos;&apos;)
  st.write(len(txt))
elif input_type == &apos;URL&apos;:
  url = st.text_input(&apos;Enter URL&apos;)
elif input_type == &apos;Multiple URLs&apos;:
  multi_url = st.text_area(&apos;Enter keywords, 1 per line&apos;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress&apos;s REST API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def update_all_tags():

  with st.spinner(&apos;Reloading tags...&apos;):

    for blog in blogs:
    
      # Get tag data
      for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):

        tag_url = f&apos;https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&amp;amp;page={pg}&apos;
        r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)
        api_tags = r_tag.json()

        for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):
          tags[&apos;Tag&apos;].append(api_tags[n][&apos;name&apos;])
          tags[&apos;ID&apos;].append(api_tags[n][&apos;id&apos;])
          tags[&apos;Count&apos;].append(api_tags[n][&apos;count&apos;])

        with open(f&quot;{blog}.json&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as outfile:
          json.dump(tags, outfile)
      tags[&apos;Tag&apos;] = []
      tags[&apos;ID&apos;] = []
      tags[&apos;Count&apos;] = []

list_of_blogs = st.radio(&quot;Select the corresponding blog&quot;, blogs)

# Load JSON files
with open(f&apos;{list_of_blogs}.json&apos;, &apos;rb&apos;) as f:
  blog_json = json.load(f)
  x = blog_json[&apos;Tag&apos;]
  for n in x:
    existing_tags.append(n)

submit = st.button(&apos;Submit&apos;)

if update_tags:
  update_all_tags()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won&apos;t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The random functions for content ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs&apos; tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags&apos; counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, they&apos;re all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. The entity, topic, and category functions using the TextRazor API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the input (text, URL, or multiple URLs), this function analyses the text, finds the topics, entities, and categories and adds them to a dictionary. I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it&apos;ll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It&apos;s worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penultimate function converts those dictionaries into dataframes. The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I&apos;ve used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Execution of the all the functions to make it work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Execute functions
if tag_ideas:
	all_blogs()
elif submit and input_type and input_type == &apos;Text&apos;:
	textrazor_extraction(&apos;Text&apos;)
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == &apos;URL&apos;:
	textrazor_extraction(&apos;URL&apos;)
	data_viz()
	main()
elif submit and input_type == &apos;Multiple URLs&apos;:
	urls = [line for line in multi_url.split(&quot;\n&quot;)]
	textrazor_extraction(&apos;Multiple URLs&apos;)
	data_viz()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have all the functions ready to call, depending on whether I&apos;m analysing raw text or URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;who_could_this_benefit&quot;&amp;gt;Who could this benefit?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I&apos;ve made this mainly for myself and as a way to improve my taxonomies. I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/&quot;&gt;also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To analyse text for entity relevance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check if your text is aligned how you want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;evaluation&quot;&amp;gt;Evaluation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Python script is not perfect. It&apos;s rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn&apos;t fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I&apos;ve been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don&apos;t like to say &quot;hey, I made this thing&quot; because who cares (that&apos;s what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Keep writing anyway</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/keep-writing-anyway/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/keep-writing-anyway/</guid><description>Writing is a marathon, not a sprint, or a less tired analogy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been poking fun at SEOs that post contextless Google Search Console graphs on LinkedIn to demonstrate their authority and achievement. Congrats, you have pages that are indexable and they&apos;ve been crawled and indexed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I&apos;m about to be a hypocrite and do the same. Well, not quite. I have a reason and ironically, it isn&apos;t SEO related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, a major contributing factor in becoming an SEO was blogging. I&apos;ve been doing it for 14 years this year and it has got me to where I am today. But I try to do less SEO in my spare time. I call it &lt;strong&gt;LESSEO&lt;/strong&gt;. It means I still care to use an SEO plugin to deal with metadata, sitemaps, and Schema. But I don&apos;t write optimised content and certainly don&apos;t care about meta title lengths. Why? Because I spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week doing it for clients and any affiliate commission I get from links is so small, I couldn&apos;t even afford a chocolate bar off it (the Milky Bars are not on me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; make an effort. An example is an article I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk/10-hippos-from-cartoons-literature-and-other-media/&quot;&gt;10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it was a good piece and could rank for whichever term I think I was targeting. But it got little-to-no traffic. But I wrote it properly this time! Eventually, I gave up on doing that again as it took too long and I knew writing with SEO in mind would put me off updating the site altogether. I am only one man with a few hours spare in the evening. It&apos;s quick musings or nothing. Hence, &lt;strong&gt;LESSEO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, something strange happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article started picking up traffic over two years later. The term driving the most traffic was &quot;famous hippo characters&quot;. That might have been what I was targeting all those months ago. What the hell happened? Why was there suddenly impressions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; clicks? I&apos;ve not looked into any trends but I was surprised. And then I figured I&apos;d change the title to target that term since &quot;10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media&quot; wasn&apos;t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&apos;s that graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressive numbers they aren&apos;t and normally, I&apos;d say nothing to write home about. But I&apos;m pretty chuffed because it showed that even though nobody visited it then, they&apos;re visiting it now and that shows two things about blogging and SEO that I&apos;ve learnt over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This stuff takes time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s almost a cliché to say &quot;SEO takes time&quot; but people still think if you publish an indexable page, it&apos;ll get indexed straight away, rank highly straight away, and get lots of traffic straight away and that&apos;s never guaranteed. It can be difficult to explain that to clients without beads of sweat dripping onto your keyboard (depending on how challenging your comms are) but it&apos;s true. That&apos;s why you have to have faith in your ability. You&apos;ll know if the content is good enough. Besides, you can&apos;t pin your strategy on one page (sorry, I&apos;m writing that to remind myself, not for anyone else to read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep writing anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have completely given up on writing anything after the hippo blog didn&apos;t gain traction. Of course, there were numerous factors as to why it didn&apos;t in the first place and I knew that at the time. But if the last 14 years have taught me anything, it&apos;s keep on writing. Even after the seeds of doubt were sown in my mind along the way, I kept going (albeit at a reduced rate). It&apos;s not about whether anyone read it. It&apos;s about the fact that I want to write it and I enjoy doing it. This is all for me. The fact I care less about SEO and still get indexed, still rank, still get visibility, and sometimes get on the first page for a cluster of 10-100 search volume keywords is wild to me, even if I only get a few clicks a month. Those are bonuses. I keep writing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&apos;s the context. It won&apos;t win me loads of claps and thumbs up on LinkedIn but it&apos;s cool to me so I&apos;ll give myself a round of applause and a thumbs up in the mirror later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this day in 2017, Roger Federer won his 18th grand slam title. It meant a lot of me as I was going through a difficult period of my life and Federer is my sporting idol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this day in 2019, I got a new job that changed my life forever. I was leaving customer service and entering the world of digital marketing. I don&apos;t exaggerate when I say my 5 years working on the phones nearly destroyed me and after 8 years of trying to get in and failing (I openly admit to &quot;giving up&quot; a few times), the success was sweeter than ever. I started work as a copywriter two months later and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This date is a date of triumph. The last couple of years have been hell but on those two days in my life, I felt like I&apos;d won the jackpot. I hope I can feel even a small amount of that today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these are commonly used apps. Google Authenticator is in the list as I need to use it to log into accounts for work. As for Clock, that&apos;s because I use the timer whenever my son brushes his teeth so he gets into the routine or brushing for 2 minutes rather than ≤30 seconds (if he&apos;s not too tired, we use Pokémon Smile which is way more fun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have regrets from that time but I don&apos;t think I would have got into this kind of stuff had I stayed so it worked out well. Besides the thousands of pounds worth of debt. But hey, at least I graduated the second time!!!&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s meant that I go down a route that&apos;s closer to my house than the original path. The downside is I still have to walk for 20-30 minutes to get home and that made me think of how cities aren&apos;t always as connected as they should be. Where I live isn&apos;t out in the sticks and neither is the detour I&apos;ve had to take. Why isn&apos;t there a better connection between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

Here&apos;s how I spent it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was my 32nd birthday on Monday. I spent it with my parents in Nice and really enjoyed it. I ate nice food, got some new clothes, relaxed, and allowed myself to bask in the gratitude and comfort of being able to visit them and not worry about anyone or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birthday last year wasn&apos;t what I&apos;d hoped because of the pandemic and while that&apos;s still here (ICYMI), I was lucky to travel abroad and not get &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/covid-19/&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; at any point before, during, or after (thank you vaccine, masks, and social distancing!) It was the kind of birthday I&apos;ve grown accustomed to in my late 20s/early 30s - spending it outside the hellhole that is the United Kingdom, either alone in &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/my-week-in-lisbon/&quot;&gt;Lisbon in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and 2018 or with my parents in Nice in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s see what happens in 2022!&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Public health</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/public-health/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/public-health/</guid><description>Imagine public health policies that included mental + physical check ups with dedicated healthcare professionals, accomodating for different cultures, genders, sexualities, + disabilities etc. etc.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine public health policies that included mental + physical check ups with dedicated healthcare professionals, accomodating for different cultures, genders, sexualities, + disabilities etc. etc. All permanently free, accessible, regularly maintained, and open to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments react different to this kind of ideology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some liken it to communism aka a cancer to society (what, more than you&apos;re giving us now?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some call it idealistic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some claim to strive for this but haven&apos;t come remotely close in decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some probably believe they have this but I don&apos;t believe they do—just ask the people of colour in your communities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health is a pillar of society. There is no social care without basic public health care and we&apos;re being let down time and time again. It&apos;s not a lack of money; we know it exists but it&apos;s spent on policies that specfiically oppose public health care (here and abroad via warfare). It&apos;s not a time constraint because we&apos;ve had decades to do it. And it&apos;s not a technology issue as the other two have combined to facilitate a lot of technology that demeans us and makes us unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t care how idealistic the above sounds to you. It&apos;s an ideal we should all strive for and it should be a bare minimum. Everyone should be able to live in safety and happiness knowing that we are cared for by the people around us. But instead, capitalism instills fear in us so we can keep their cogs turning and not even an ongoing pandemic can stop it. In fact, it&apos;s somehow made capitalists dig their heels in and make more profit in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

No way.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m very protective over the art of &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; because, without it, I would absolutely not be where I am today. No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s despite (6) years of doubt over the purpose of it all. But I made significant connections that got me into a line of work that met my needs and I&apos;ve been able to flourish on my own terms, which I&apos;m immensely grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging in its most perceived form isn&apos;t what it used to be (now more affiliate/commercial vs. journaling/niche community writing, although the latter never died) but it&apos;s by no means dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one recommendation I always make when asked how to get into digital marketing is &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/get-a-website/&quot;&gt;get a website&lt;/a&gt;. A blog is an easy way to do that (remember a blog is just a website). It&apos;s not about &quot;no one will read it&quot;. Most won&apos;t. But it should primarily be for you as it has been for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write whatever the hell I want without thought for search volumes and that&apos;s why ranking for anything is amazing to me. But it has wider implications. You can express yourself, learn, make mistakes, and refine. Helpful if you don&apos;t feel comfortable talking to people IRL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week has been hell, mentally. And while I&apos;m feeling marginally better, I&apos;m now exhausted. Had a big rant on Instagram about psychiatry and how we all shout about getting therapy but it can&apos;t solve everything and it shouldn&apos;t be used as a default resolution for every problem we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need it? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need it for the crap that&apos;s thrown me off this week? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase ‘new normal’ is one that grinds my gears in a very particular way, because look around… nothing has fundamentally changed. We’ve had almost 2 years to review our processes and approach to literally everything and what do we have?
Same old, with a mask on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It echoed a lot of sentiments I&apos;ve had in my head, rolling around like an unwanted red sock in a washing machine of white clothes. Something I&apos;ve noticed about this &apos;new normal&apos; (🤢) from a personal perspective is how my week has completely flipped. It used to consist of working amongst people Monday to Friday, doing the psuedo-extrovert stuff and coming home in the evening. Then I&apos;d chill at the weekend on my jays doing mostly nothing. But now, it&apos;s almost the opposite. I now work from home (subject to slight change), I&apos;m on my own and when I&apos;m done I just close my laptop and... leave the room. At weekends, however, at least in the last few weeks. I&apos;ve been going out to different places and meeting up with people. I went to Birmingham a couple of weeks ago for teh first time in nearly 2 years, then went again with my son the week after, and this weekend I was at a family gathering. AND I&apos;ve got a long overdue meet up with a friend to see Candyman at a real life cinema. I also plan to see my parents at some point next month and, if I&apos;m lucky, go to Lisbon for my birthday (something I did in 2017 and 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not one of those YOLO types where I&apos;m making up for lost time by engorging my soul into socialisation. It&apos;s just that things have worked out this way. I still prefer my own company in my own house to relax and do nothing. But the role reversal has been strange and interesting. In some ways, I get a little bit more relaxed alone time by being at home to work for the week. I don&apos;t have to talk to people unless I make a video call. I&apos;m still working but it&apos;s easier. Eventually, things will go back to something resembling what they were pre-pandemic and I&apos;ll adjust again. I just hope it&apos;s not 7 days of socialising. I can only fake my extroversion for so long and I already have 2 years of unpacked pandemic anxiety, depression, and existential crises to sort out without adding a loss of identity to add to it (just kidding, I have that too!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the new normal can suck it and people who&apos;ve learnt nothing and changed nothing during this current-and-still-happening pandemic can suck it too.&lt;/p&gt;

They have the power to block, ban, and remove whatever you do and not give you an explanation. You may never get it back and there&apos;s almost nothing you can do about it. You effectively rent space and hope they don&apos;t pull the rug from under you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s not to say you shouldn&apos;t use them (although there&apos;s a case for that which I won&apos;t go into here) but it&apos;s dangerous to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use social media platforms to showcase your work and not have any kind of backup. That&apos;s why having a website or a space you are in more/full control of is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like Twitter, Instagram, et al should be extending tools and platforms. It&apos;s not wise to decentralise your art and give the responsibility to third parties who don&apos;t have your best interests at heart. Get that website, make it your main hub, and use other platforms are offshoots. The best case scenario would be to create your own site from scratch but that&apos;s not accessible to everyone so here&apos;s a list of options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web builders/blog platforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wix.com/&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webflow.com/&quot;&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hostgator.com/&quot;&gt;Gator from Hostgator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cargo.site/&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web hosts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IONOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krystal.uk/&quot;&gt;Krystal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluehost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HostGator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hostinger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GreenGeeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DreamHost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HostPapa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Website Planet have also put together a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-green-web-hosting-services/&quot;&gt;the best green Web hosts&lt;/a&gt; you should check out if eco-friendliness is something you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above options have an element of risk. You could still lose your work or have it taken down as you&apos;re still renting space (and paying for it this time). That can make it less viable than using a free social media platform. So weigh up the pros and cons and what you want to create and showcase and whether it&apos;s worth it to you. Then, gain control back. Well, more than you had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really cool tilt-shift video featuring people on the beach (and, before you wince, this was filmed 13 years ago. Then again, there&apos;s more social distancing here than in the current day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re in this together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was their attempt at social unity during those &lt;em&gt;unprecedented times&lt;/em&gt;. But it soon became apparent we weren&apos;t all in this together, if &quot;we&quot; meant everyone on Earth. Why? Because the gulf between rich and poor grew even deeper as corporations like Amazon and Apple earnt billions as more people fell further below the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remember seeing varations of the following phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re all in the same storm but we&apos;re not in the same boat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made a lot more sense. The rich were in their yachts (figuratively and literally) while everyone else was struggling to get through in their proverbial sailboats, weather-beaten and close to destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as time has gone on and multi-billionaires trade their boats for spaceships, I begin to wonder... are they even in the same storm now? Yeah, there are vaccines and—depending on what country and demographic you observe—vaccination rates are increasing but the pandemic is still here, infection rates are increasing again, and things are opening up at the same time. This is still not a relaxing time. But those rich white dudes are flying into space while we struggle. They&apos;re literally leaving the storm and I don&apos;t think they were ever in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re shocked it&apos;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t tell me it&apos;s 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fucking know. We&apos;re still living through a pandemic. We watched the protests last year. Our parents went through worse, as did their parents, ad infinitum. It&apos;s part of human history and written as footnotes in textbooks where owners of enslaved people take centre stage as put-out entrepreneurs once it was &quot;abolished&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t need your indignation because it does nothing but centre you. We need you to use your privilege. Normally, I&apos;d write this on Twitter but I&apos;m sick to death of saying these things and people proverbially seal clapping. What good are likes, RTs and replies of agreement right now? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.busybeingblack.com/&quot;&gt;Josh Rivers, founder of Busy Being Black&lt;/a&gt;, made a good suggestion on Instagram tonight: if you&apos;re using social media to say you&apos;re shocked, you have the power to block and report racist abuse you see, contacting people in power and telling them it&apos;s happening and you want it to stop. Do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;. What the hell kind of reading were you allegedly doing last year that you can&apos;t do anything but tap some buttons on your phone and just go about your day as if it doesn&apos;t concern you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don&apos;t DM me and don&apos;t send me any kind of messages (and I really need you to listen this time). Because I&apos;m beyond tired and I don&apos;t care about your guilt or commiserations. Be an active accomplice, not an apathetic ally.&lt;/p&gt;

But what has changed?</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a year since the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-death-of-george-floyd-in-context&quot;&gt;George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. It was a watershed moment for a lot of people when it could have been avoided. I&apos;m still tired, still angry, still suspicious, and still reeling from the last year. I allowed myself to think changes could be made but white people let me down. Again. And while Black communities have responded and shifted and fought hard in that time which has helped me and many other, nothing has really changed besides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aunt-jemima-brand-will-change-name-remove-image-quaker-says-n1231260&quot;&gt;some names on food packaging&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve seen so-called allies get his name wrong on videos, buy books to &quot;do the reading&quot;, give them away without starting them, make snide comments about &quot;not being woke enough&quot;, complain of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blackyouthproject.com/allyship-fatigue-is-an-insult-to-black-folks-who-never-get-to-rest/&quot;&gt;ally fatigue&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/blackout-tuesday-guide.html&quot;&gt;post black squares&lt;/a&gt; only to take them down because they messed up the grid, people remain silent despite their presence and influence within Black cultures. It&apos;s been a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes it look like George Floyd died so Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima could retire from their advertising duties and got a &quot;thanks, bro&quot; from Nancy Pelosi. &lt;em&gt;How sweet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Lives Still Matter and fuck the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging makes us more oriented toward an intellectual bottom line, more interested in the directly empirical, more tolerant of human differences, more analytical in the course of daily life, more interested in people who are interesting, and less patient with Continental philosophy. All you bloggers out there, or spouses of bloggers, what effects do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it&apos;s about self-expression (alongside self-experimentation). I work as an SEO for 35 hours a week so my entire career revolves around the Web. But there are limits to what I can do with that because I have responsibility to my employer and my clients. Outside those hours, &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;I can blog about anything I want&lt;/a&gt; and say whatever I want (within reason of course). If I want to write a blog post comprised of a single sentence or a sole image, I can. I love that freedom and it took me a while to fully embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for tolerance to human differences, I&apos;m quite the opposite because human differences often involve oppression and I refuse to tolerate that in any form. I don&apos;t blog about things I don&apos;t agree with because plenty of other people do that and that&apos;s not what I blog for. People may allude that to an echo chamber but it&apos;s my party and I&apos;ll blog what I want to—notably what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; believe in with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of all of this is a change in how I consume media and how I engage with it. I tweeted last night how my connection with Twitter, and social media in general, had diminished. I don&apos;t read my TL as much as specific lists that give me exactly what I want and nothing more. It saves me doomscrolling and I can be online without wishing I wasn&apos;t (as much). Blogging is my outlet and escape from whatever the hell is happening out there and it has saved me during this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, here&apos;s a list of American cereals I&apos;d buy if someone gave me £100 to spend in an American candy store (because I&apos;ve been watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Shonduras&quot;&gt;Shonduras&apos;s videos&lt;/a&gt; all weekend with my son and he loves cereal):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucky Charms - £4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Froot Loops Tropical - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Froot Loops Wild Berry - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trix - £4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruity Pebbles - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden Crisp - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maple Cheerios - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raisin Bran - £5.49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corn Pops - £5.79&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden Grahams - £5.49&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cocoa Puffs - £4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon Toast Crunch - £5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Jacks - £1.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This list is unfinished.)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some videos I&apos;ve been watching to keep my mind off things. Might make this into a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Jamie Foxx roasting Doug Williams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq2ivETREGo&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s old but I found this again via another video and it&apos;s been good to revisit this hilarious meta-roast and get some laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Prince&apos;s While My Guitar Gently weeps guitar solo, but with More Prince&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRCooFKk3c&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classic I regularly watch but this new version has more close ups of Prince and my goodness, it&apos;s even better. I actually welled up today watching it. Breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Clips of Star Trek&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FggqbNUZD8U&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have been of The Next Generation but Deep Space 9 will always be my #1. This clips shows Elim Garak giving zero fucks about Gul Dukat&apos;s feelings and I love him for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Aaron &apos;Cybertron&apos; Zheng&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adVF6bcyZjc&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continue to get into Pokémon VGC, I keep watching Aaron &apos;Cybertron&apos; Zheng&apos;s awesome videos for inspiration, tips, and the love of Pokémon. He&apos;s one of the greatest VGC players of all time and if you&apos;re into VGC, you need to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Khruangbin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsSmzapbKv4&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just listen. And find more of their music and listen some more. They&apos;re my pick for best band out right now and that&apos;ll be the happiest hill I&apos;ll ever die on.&lt;/p&gt;

And when we die, they call it sacrifice or justified, whichever fits their narrative. These actions mean they don&apos;t see us as human at any point in our lives and that hurts and we have to live our lives trying to avoid these people as much as possible. Our lives are not for them to use. George Floyd&apos;s death was not a sacrifice that rich white liberals should thank him for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said on Twitter last night:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Justice&apos; and &apos;accountability&apos; rolls off the tongue a little too easily for many of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your abhorrent rhetoric to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Must be something in this vaccine...</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a big fan of Marijn van Hoorn&apos;s blogosphere and they wrote a piece on how they got vaccinated (can&apos;t find the blog post now). My favourite line was the last one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a day, and other than a dull annoyance in my upper arm and a sudden urge to buy a Windows Phone, i haven’t noticed any symptoms. I’ve heard the Pfizer one is worse on the second go, though, so wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a pretty serious side effect! A Windows Phone in 2021? I hope they don&apos;t actually buy it with the second vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/my-phone-history/&quot;&gt;And to think I bought one&lt;/a&gt; without a needle or a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marketers can get caught up in specific metrics, focusing on those data points that make you look good in reporting, but don’t help you understand your performance. In this week’s episode of Whiteboard Friday, Dr. Pete discusses the vanity we bring to the metrics we track, and how to take a better, more realistic view of your results.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since GDPR came into our lives, we&apos;ve all had to struggle with obtaining our basic privacy rights. With each cookie banner we have all been honing our skills, learning to navigate ambiguous options and distrust obvious buttons. Now is your chance to show what you have learnt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s only for the night although if tomorrow is as bad as today, I&apos;ll extend it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I deactivated from Twitter. It&apos;s only for the night although if tomorrow is as bad as today, I&apos;ll extend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with the Meghan Markle interview with Oprah. If her saddening accounts of experiencing racism—towards herself and her son—and suicidal thoughts weren&apos;t bad enough, people were exploiting the situation for Twitter coverage. After getting called out (by me and a Black woman), a couple of the tweets I saw were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the shitty &quot;women belong in the kitchen&quot; tweet from Burger King which was meant to be a clickbait opener to stating the company&apos;s committment to better gender representation. Not cool. &quot;Ironic&quot; sexism is just sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of questionable mentions of gender representation, I saw more conflations of International Women&apos;s Day and being a woman with being non-binary. They are not the same. You can&apos;t just say &quot;women and non-binary people&quot; if non-binary people haven&apos;t called for it and not on a day that isn&apos;t for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, today has shown a lot of people for the fake allies they are (if they were even allies to begin with). I tweeted my 2 cents and bounced for the night. I won&apos;t feel a way about making it longer and I have a feeling I might.&lt;/p&gt;

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 12 things I&apos;ve picked up over that period.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/first-year-professional-seo/&quot;&gt;read about my first year here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&apos;ve learnt in my second year as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Women in SEO are still the best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hasn&apos;t changed from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn&apos;t have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Experts still aren&apos;t experts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. You can&apos;t rely on others to make changes in diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can&apos;t rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won&apos;t face their internal situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s partly why I started my Marketers of Colour project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That&apos;s my sole focus right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. John Mueller is even more awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, if you&apos;re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keywords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. It&apos;s still about topics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I&apos;ve seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don&apos;t copy your competition, you &quot;listen&quot; to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I&apos;m more of a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; in SEO (and that&apos;s not a criticism in this game!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It&apos;s where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 being 2020, I didn&apos;t do much with Python besides using the scripts I&apos;d already written. But I need to get back into it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. I love Ahrefs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it&apos;s so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. I need to finally use a new API for a project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven&apos;t done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the PokéAPI. Something with natures. I don&apos;t know. Help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. I want to get better at link building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the &quot;dark side&quot; aka digital PR and while I&apos;ll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. You shouldn&apos;t &quot;live and breathe marketing&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to &quot;live and breathe&quot; what you do isn&apos;t it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn&apos;t so important that it has to consume your existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;ve become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I&apos;m glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There&apos;ll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn&apos;t be the only thing we face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. I love writing for the Small Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They&apos;re at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I haven&apos;t explained what they are. Briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for &lt;em&gt;conversions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;landing pages&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sales funnels&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ROI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Web = the old days of &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; where you wrote about stuff that wasn&apos;t for SEO, posted links with no other content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won&apos;t rank as highly. It&apos;s that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much on SEO. In some cases, I don&apos;t care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; got traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask me what advice I&apos;d give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say &quot;get a blog&quot;. Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shout outs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And loads of other people I&apos;ve not mentioned who have made my second year as an SEO a great one.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Sustained grief</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/sustained-grief/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/sustained-grief/</guid><description>Some thoughts on sustained grief, inspired by bell hooks</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_Zeets/status/1366155880966799360&quot;&amp;gt;@_Zeets on Twitter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; posted this bell hooks quote earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustained grief is particularly disturbing in culture that offers a quick fix for any pain. Sometimes it amazes me to know intuitively that the grieving are all around us yet we do not see any overt signs about grief that lingers. Like a stain on our clothes, it marks us as flawed, imperfect. To cling to grief, to desire its expression, is to be out of sync with modern life, where the hip do not get bogged down in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me—amongst all the reminders I&apos;ve had since March 2020—that I&apos;ve been in some state of grief every year for at least a decade. Before I used to think they were small and insignificant. Break ups are a natural part of life if you choose to love. Interview rejections are part and parcel of being a member of a capitalist society. Your idols die because everybody will some day. But if you don&apos;t deal with things, they accumulate and I am the product of that accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never felt like I&apos;ve had the &quot;luxury&quot; of grieving when I&apos;ve had to carry on. Some days, you just want to curl in a ball and not leave that spot for days. I guess I have done that before. But the fear of being asked about it by loved ones often pulls me out. &lt;em&gt;Maybe it wasn&apos;t that bad then&lt;/em&gt;. But it becomes grief deferred or sustained grief as bell hooks described it. And because of how society works, the solution is always a book or a chat or a change in diet or a walk. But you&apos;ll read with that grief, chat with that grief, eat with that grief, walk with that grief, and sleep with that grief. And you learn to live with it; to function &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt;. I&apos;m still here so I&apos;ve not done too badly but I know I could do so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

I was reading an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/07/05/better-living-through-self-deception&quot;&gt;Better living through self-deception&lt;/a&gt; and this paragraph struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard model of the happy, smart, successful human being is someone who knows more, works hard, and has found, or at least is heading toward, their own personal meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could make a couple of changes, I&apos;d say knowing enough is better than knowing &quot;more&quot; and working smarter rather than harder but the key element was reaching your own personal meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People spend their lives searching for THE meaning of life when they could be working towards THEIR meaning of life. No two life experiences are identical and it&apos;s up to us to find a purpose, bespoke to us (if we want to. I don&apos;t subscribe to the notion that everyone has a calling, that it&apos;s our destiny, and we should all do that forever). The point is we have the power to do what we want in that regard. It doesn&apos;t matter about aptitudes. A lot of that is rooted in bigotry and hypercapitalist ideals (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history&quot;&gt;Myers-Briggs personality tests&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://interestingengineering.com/science/the-notorious-inaccuracies-and-failings-of-iq-tests&quot;&gt;racist history of IQ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is there a word for soul searching but for blogs? Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been doing a lot of that lately because as my output has increased, so have my questions about why I blog at all. It&apos;s nothing new; I&apos;ve asking myself why for nearly a decade. It started out as fun and then fear of no one reading but I carried on regardless because I knew &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I know more do but I can&apos;t shake off the feeling despite my continuation. I think I&apos;ve written at least one blog post every month since 2011 and, as I write this, I&apos;ve realised that&apos;s 10 years. This opposes my generally reserved demeanour but perhaps it doesn&apos;t. After all, I&apos;m more talkative in environments I feel comfortable in and a CMS backend is as cosy as they come for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my journey, I found this 2018 article from Rohan Maitzen called &lt;a href=&quot;https://rohanmaitzen.com/2018/11/13/a-brief-return-to-meta-blogging/&quot;&gt;A Brief Return to Meta-Blogging&lt;/a&gt;. I resonated the most with this part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got into blogging because you wanted to write about what you were reading, read about what other people were reading, and have a bit of discussion in both directions, I think (though my experience may not be representative, as it always depends on particulars) you might not feel things have changed all that much, at least in the spirit of the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in reference to a change in the blogosphere that happened towards the late 00s, when the popular indie bloggers started getting jobs at corporate publications, they became more money/ad-driven, and the faux-liberalism drifted even further to the right. Suddenly, &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; about your experiences became rhetoric-pushing through the guise of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, changed how readers perceived the remaining indie bloggers and their output in a general sense. And the blogosphere shrunk more as time went on. I joined it all in 2008 without knowing any of this (I did my due diligence and read old stuff from the likes of Jason Kottke and did my research so as this is second/third-hand information, I suggest you do the same and don&apos;t take my paraphrasing as gospel - even if my name is Luke!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the present day and the quote. That&apos;s exactly why I blog. I like to write about what I read, read about other people doing the same, and share my thoughts amongst it all. SEO has played a varying part in all that but I think therefore I write. And, yes, the spirit remains because apparently the flame hasn&apos;t died for about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I do plug my Patreon in relation to this because all of this does cost me money (&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/how-much-do-my-blogs-cost/&quot;&gt;and I discussed this last year&lt;/a&gt;) but I don&apos;t try to acquire Andrew Sullivan or Laurie Penny levels of income (or try to attain their intellectual level of garbage that garner the money). My means are small in comparison and I feel if people enjoy it, they can pay it forward if that&apos;s a possibility for them. But I don&apos;t blog &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; money. There&apos;s no money in content, at least not inherently, and certainly not in the kind of stuff I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for another quote from the same piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not really going anywhere in particular with this: I’m just thinking out loud in public, which is what having a blog lets me do! I also trusted (because it works every time I’m in a blogging slump) that if I actually started writing something, anything, here, things would start to turn around for me, because the process itself is a tonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&apos;t have put it better myself. And so I&apos;ll leave it there. Without a major point. Just another ramble from yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;

Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a couple of weeks off from my main Twitter account as it was getting too much and I knew the holiday period would be difficult for my mental health (spoiler alert: it was).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m kinda back but I&apos;m not tweeting as much because I&apos;m still uncomfortable about it. All the talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/covid-19/&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic, the meta-discourse about the pandemic, and marketing industry chat is a lot to jump back into. I also don&apos;t give a crap about marketing right now. I will still do work to the best of my ability and I still enjoy the technicalities of what &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/seo/&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; is/should be about but the constant talk about tips and ideas—regurgitated from the same places offering little to no tangible solutions or actions for people to work with—drain me. My peers do it or share it and I just find it dull and annoying. Not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, most of the overall online chat I&apos;m seeing is grating on me and I can&apos;t spend too long &quot;logged on&quot;. And to that end, I&apos;m beyond tired again and while I&apos;ve told people I&apos;m okay (because I am physically and logistically), mentally I&apos;m not and I haven&apos;t been since March last year when this all kicked off. I know I need therapy but not CBT this time and I&apos;ll try to seek that this year. I&apos;ve lost things dear to me and I have a lot of unresolved issues to overcome and reconcile with. I also have a son to look after amongst all this shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&apos;re reading this and got this far, you don&apos;t have to tell me you&apos;re &quot;there for me&quot; or anything. I don&apos;t know who or when to talk to anyone just yet (unless you&apos;re a Black therapist, in which case let&apos;s talk!) and ultimately, I want to be left alone to feel better and hope I can someday leave the house and maybe even my city for something other than a COVID test or an alternative Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

At the time of writing, I&apos;ve listened to 195 and it&apos;s been a revelation. A lot of great music came out in a year where it would have been acceptable to curl into a ball and not want to create anything. But my favourite artists did and produced some of their best works to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list below isn&apos;t a ranked list, although the top 7 are my overall top 7 for the year in a rough order. &lt;em&gt;Agüita&lt;/em&gt; is for sure my #1 and &lt;em&gt;Mordechai&lt;/em&gt; is a very close second. Knxwledge&apos;s &lt;em&gt;1988&lt;/em&gt; was so damn good, as was Ahwlee&apos;s &lt;em&gt;VII&lt;/em&gt; which was like a hip hop RKO outta nowhere. The biggest surprise was Maelo Ruiz&apos;s &lt;em&gt;La Unica&lt;/em&gt;, a salsa album I would never have found if it wasn&apos;t for a Python script I created (I might publish it some day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enjoy and buy them if you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gabriel Garzón-Montano – Agüita&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Khruangbin – Mordechai&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ahwlee – VII&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jessie Ware – What&apos;s Your Pleasure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dua Lipa – Future Nostalgia&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Blu &amp;amp; Exile – Miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamaal Williams – Wu Hen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla – Into the Dream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rina Sawayama – SAWAYAMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily King – Sides&lt;/li&gt;

After all, that&apos;s how they made all that money, right? But for every successful business, there have been a lot of failures which would have bankrupted or otherwise ruined other businesses–or people for that matter (and they probably have but why spoil a successful capitalist story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent work interview, I was asked what success looked like for me. It felt like a more helpful version of &quot;where do you see yourself in five years?&quot; and I found it easier to answer. But for a while, I&apos;ve thought about the epic failures from the likes of Disney, Apple, Microsoft, and Sir Richard Branson (to name a few) and how they&apos;ve been glossed over because they&apos;re worth trillions between them. Even if those failures were proportionally scaled to smaller businesses or people, they&apos;d be seen as cautionary tales and seen for what they were - failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is failure seen as admirable risk-taking for some people but comical mismanagement for others? If we&apos;re asked to define our own successes, we should be able to define our own failures and there shouldn&apos;t be a hierarchal disparity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve focussed a lot on business for these examples but it might be clearer to see the differences when we look at politics. Take a look at Boris Johnson. His failures have involved the deaths of thousands of people, racism against thousands more, and a general apathy towards people who aren&apos;t rich Tories (emphasis on rich because he doesn&apos;t give a shit about working or middle class Tory voters despite the rhetoric). Now look at Diane Abbott, a Black woman and trailblazing MP who is seens as incompetent and foolish for merely existing. People take pride in laughing at her and pointing at her faults and the moment you point out the misogynoir, they get heated and play the reverse race card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&apos;re going to define our successes or failures, we need to take into account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effect on ourselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effect on other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we accomplished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we learnt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably some other stuff I&apos;ve forgotten because I&apos;m not a sage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve harmed people at any point is not a cause for celebration. Morals cannot be separated from business because business involves people at its fundamental level. The same for politics, sport, art, literature, food and drink, tech, everything. Let&apos;s focus one of the top failures in society right now: looking after people properly. Those successful people and companies have pillaged lives that will never come remotely close to that success and that is a monumental failure that has to be seen for what it is. Now.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it be for his impeccable choice of samples through a multitude of different styles, his uncanny knack of blowing your mind with his musicianship or his humility in a sea of egos and gold chains, he is revered as a legend beyond the realms of hip-hop music, and rightfully so. But perhaps something that he doesn’t get enough credit for, publicly at least, is his drumming techniques, both acoustic and digital. The Detroit producer was mean on the MPC but his live drumming had influences on a number of his peers, particularly Questlove and Kariem Riggins, who have since helped carry his legacy on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story goes that Amp Fiddler, a fellow Detroitian, was the man who gave Dilla his first MPC. It had a minor fault and no manual at hand, but he found a way to get it working and the rest is hip-hop history. From there, he improved his craft and soon surpassed his main idols—Pete Rock and DJ Premier. At Dilla’s wake, Pete Rock remaked that he used to be the king but Dilla had taken the crown soon after. His technique started similarly to his peers of the time. The early ’90s gave birth to “jazz rap” and the complementing drum breaks that came with it, thanks to Prince Paul and A Tribe Called Quest. By 1993, Tribe and co. had moved onto free drumming, in the pocket, classic boom bap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for Dilla to show what he had to offer on a major stage for The Pharcyde, it was 1995 and a year after what is known by fans as the “Second Golden Age” period of 1993-1994. “Runnin’” heralded the start of an illustrious career. Producing under the name “Jay Dee,” his music triggered the attention of Q-Tip and he managed to acquire his services for Tribe’s final two albums. Despite the internal strife Tribe were experiencing, Jay Dee, now performing under the collective name of The Ummah, let his music do the talking. Unlike the drum programming on Labcabincalifornia, the patterns on Beats, Rhymes &amp;amp; Life and The Love Movement were a lot looser, slightly off time at moments. This apparent “sloppiness” was no accident, however. Jay was playing it human. Allowing the kicks and snares to be slightly out of time moved the percussion aware from a machine feel and gave added weight to the swing and soul of the music. The two albums he featured on weren’t met with the same acclaim as the first three Tribe albums but that was more due to the ongoing strife between Tip and Phife as opposed to Jay Dee’s production quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questlove once told XXL Magazine a story of how Dilla had used a beaten up drum kit on the Donald Byrd cover “Think Twice” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla had used a vibraphone mallet and a broken drumstick with toilet paper and rubber bands wrapped around it because he didn’t know where to get proper drumsticks late at night. His reasoning for using a mallet was to keep the dynamic less aggressive. Questlove subsequently went out and bought orchestra mallets and tried it out when he had to fly out to Philly. Even before that time, Dilla had been instrumental (pun intended) in the rhythmic and percussive elements of D’Angelo’s Voodoo (although not officially credited), pushing the human element of the drum programming all the way. Questlove clearly learnt a lot from this approach as his performances on the opener “Playa Playa,” for example, exhibits the funky swing of the rimshot against the booming bass drum to give a distinct sound that permeated throughout the whole album. As Quest said himself, “The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.” Talking to Okayplayer, Quest remarked that “Word Play” on Tribe’s Beats, Rhymes &amp;amp; Life singlehandedly changed his thinking towards drumming, because of the sloppiness of the kick, executed with “finesse and defiance.“ Looking at where he is right now in terms of success, that was a pretty big influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Dilla’s second “era” came around, the gritty street feel mixed with the brief beginnings of his electro phase, Karriem Riggins had already known the Detroit producer for five years, having met him through Common in ’96. In that time, he had provided his drumming expertise on “2 U 4 U” and later produced “The Clapper” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla’s influence on Riggins was as profound, maybe more so after the release of his debut album, Alone/Together, which featured the track “J Dilla The Greatest.” “I learned different ways to get certain feels out of the machine, to basically convey an idea,” he told XXL Mag. “Turning the time shifting off and playing the track live. I think his approach was different every time.” Riggins illustrated the point further in a video with Peanut Butter Wolf and J.Rocc. Using the machine, be it a MPC or one of the newer Maschines, as a tool rather than the music maker allowed for more human flexibility in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask most producers right now some of their main influences and you’ll hear Dilla’s name mentioned pretty much every time. The reason behind this may differ from musician to musician but the general crux of it comes from his approach to the whole process, from start to finish. There’s also an element of curiosity; what sample did he use on that cut, how did he get the snare to sound like that without it being too brash? Video series like Waajeed’s “Bling47 Breaks Dilla Edition” answered some of those burning questions with the purpose to demystify Dilla and his production, according to Waajeed himself. Jazz drummer Damion Reid, talking to NPR Music, expressed his admiration for Dilla’s ability to encompass every element within his compositions, “every drum, every nuance, every atmospheric sound was strategically placed. Jay Dee embodied, to me, the culmination of all those things.” Last year, ERIMAJ released his debut album Conflict Of A Man and featured his take on Dilla’s “Nothing Like This,” one of his most enigmatic works. Drummer/producer Jamire Williams captured the essence of the original, the arena anthem percussion, while adapting it to cater to his own style with the added Rhodes and guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of drummers and drummers-turned-producers with some connection to Dilla through direct communication or a mutual stylistic respect is mind boggling. Dilla, the patron saint of modern day drummers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, 95 percent of all the e-mail received by critics and columnists is civil, friendly or respectfully constructive;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but WHEREAS, this is the Internet age, and we&apos;re all anonymous and can avoid making eye contact forever;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and WHEREAS, there&apos;s so much information overload, a little heat and drama on your part may be necessary just to be heard above the din;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and WHEREAS, many of those who fire off potshots are missing out on some of the best techniques for effective snippiness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THEREFORE let us now post the rules for membership in the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the strongest language possible. Calling names is always effective, and four-letter words show that you mean business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a violent opinion of something doesn&apos;t require you to actually try it yourself. After all, plenty of people heatedly object to books they haven&apos;t read or movies they haven&apos;t seen. Heck, you can imagine perfectly well if something is any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&apos;s a positive review that you didn&apos;t like, call the reviewer a &quot;fanboy.&quot; Do not entertain the notion that the product, service, show, movie, book or restaurant might, in fact, be good. Instead, assume that the reviewer has received payment from the reviewee. Work in the word &quot;shill&quot; if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&apos;s a negative review, call the reviewer a &quot;basher&quot; and describe the review as a &quot;hatchet job.&quot; Accuse him of being paid off by the reviewee&apos;s &lt;em&gt;rival&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&apos;s a mixed review, ignore the passages that balance the argument. Pretend that the entire review is all positive or all negative. Refer to it either as a &quot;rave&quot; or a &quot;slam.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find a sentence early in the article that rubs you the wrong way, you are by no means obligated to finish reading. Stop right where you are--express your anger while it&apos;s still good and hot! What are the odds that the writer is going to say anything else relevant to your point later in the piece, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the writer responds to your e-mail with evidence that you&apos;re wrong (for example, by citing a paragraph that you overlooked), disappear without responding. This is the anonymous Internet; slipping away without consequence or civility is your privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let generalities slip by. Don&apos;t tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience. Ignore conditional words like &quot;generally,&quot; &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;most.&quot; If you read a sentence that says, for example, &quot;The VisionPhone is among the first consumer videophones,&quot; cite the reviewer&apos;s ignorance and laziness for failing to mention the prototype developed by AT&amp;amp;T for the 1964 World&apos;s Fair. Send copies of your note to the publication&apos;s publisher and, if possible, its advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(14 years later, it&apos;s only got worse.)&lt;/p&gt;

I tweeted this yesterday and people have reached out since, which I&apos;m grateful for. I&apos;m not in a state that warrants therapy or someone professional to speak to but I know my options if necessary. My tiredness is fundamentally two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal stuff I won&apos;t go into because it&apos;s... personal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racism against &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/black/&quot;&gt;Black people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not gonna discuss #1 but I will talk about #2. It&apos;s very difficult to be aware of the fact that your identity evokes a rage in other people to the point they want you to be dead. Or severely injured. Or to suffer a lifetime of abuse, financial difficulties, and destitution. But it&apos;s not as explicit as that some days. Other times, it&apos;s a socially acceptable ignorance that, if you criticise, you receive a barrage of abuse or the flicker of a gaslight that burns brighter with every response. And it takes an ounce of your strength until you have none left. I&apos;ve been running on empty for months. Time away only lasts so long. Talking only works for so long if at all. Focussing on other things only masks it for so long. When will other people make the effort? Why do I have to listen and give resources for them to learn? Why, when they had an opportunity to really DO something, they decided a black square on Instagram was all they could muster, only to take it down a few weeks later when it fucked up their arbitrary grid system? And when you call them out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At least they did something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I need some time away to collect my thoughts and come up with the right words.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Insert single emoji here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I meant to do with that? Buried amongst the tiredness is a burning desire to scream in the ears of the ignorant so they can feel just one ounce of my anger and frustration. If the bare minimum is too much for you, get the hell out of my space. The historical evidence is in front of your face and the work has always been there to do. But no, you need an invite or someone to check your work. I will not comfort you when you apologise when my comfort has been a second class citizen for so long. You will listen to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; now. And I am tired and hurting. Every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be left alone to live and do what I want and need to do and not find out Black people are dying or being denied basic quality of life because of White supremacy. I want White people to face up to their privilege and their place in that White supremacist system and do all they can to break it from within—that&apos;s not for me and those Black superheroes to do by default. I want Black women and Black trans people to have a safe environment to be themselves and fuck shit up in every sense of the word. I want them to be paid double the amount a mediocre White man gets because they deserve it. Call it reparations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until that happens, I&apos;ll have to find a way to deal with whatever &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is. And when someone asks how I am, I&apos;ll find a new line to give them, delete it, and settle for &quot;tired but alive&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like I&apos;m carrying the tiredness of my ancestors on top of my own. Every subatomic particle that makes up my life force is exhausted. I need to purify myself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka. It&apos;s the only way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came after a break up that opened old wounds and I needed someone to talk to and guide me out. In one of the sessions, I retold a story that had happened a few days prior. I was amongst friends and acquaintances at a pub when I overheard a conversation about Black Panther. The person leading the conversation claimed it was the worst MCU movie because of its implausibility, particularly Shuri&apos;s technical abilities as a 16 year old. I seethed in silence but it was bad enough that I spent most of my hour talking about why it made me so angry and why Black Panther meant so much to me. My (White) therapist was very receptive and agreed with my reasoning, which I didn&apos;t expect and welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact I felt so strongly about this movie that I brought it up as the focal point of a counselling session meant it had gone beyond so many other films I&apos;d seen in my life. Not even my favourite movie of all time, Batman Returns, a film I&apos;ve seen at least three times a year since I was 3, would come close in my soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it hasn&apos;t been enough to dispel the spectre of White supremacy. After Chadwick Boseman&apos;s death, I felt myself searching in my mind for evidence that I wasn&apos;t performing at being sad. &quot;Black Panther did have that effect on me, right? I didn&apos;t just immerse myself in it recently?&quot; that&apos;s what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. &quot;died&quot; in Infinity War—actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now). And yet, I still had to confirm that I wasn&apos;t pretending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put that down to the chokehold of White supremacy, making me second guess my identity as a mixed race Black man. You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I&apos;ve always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn&apos;t belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn&apos;t crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people. As someone who works on the Internet for a living, I have a professional and moral duty to do something about it. And so I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Panther wasn&apos;t the first time I felt Black but it put my soul in the right place and enriched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Chadwick. Wakanda Forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said&quot;&gt;@nyt_first_said&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href=&quot;https://maxbittker.github.io/clear-pipes/&quot;&gt;a visual &quot;machine&quot;&lt;/a&gt; of how they find the unique words they tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, a script scrapes new articles from nytimes.com. That text is tokenized, or split into words based on whitespace and punctuation.
Each word then must pass several criteria. Containing a number or special character is criteria for disqualification. To avoid proper nouns, all capitalized words are filtered.
The most important check is against the New York Time&apos;s archive search service. The archive goes back to 1851 and contains more than 13 million articles.
The paper publishes many thousands of words each day, but only a very few are firsts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like these kinds of Twitter accounts, finding genuinely unique content.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&apos;s how much.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I continue working on my microscopic media empire (stolen from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/09/im-jason-kottke-creator-of-kottkeorg-and-this-is-how-i-parent/&quot;&gt;Jason Kottke&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimestill.com/2016/02/ceo-and-7-minute-workout.html?m=1&quot;&gt;other people&lt;/a&gt;), I asked myself: whow much does it cost to run all &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/&quot;&gt;my blogs and various mini projects&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to keep it easy and calculate all the outgoings in 2020 so far and income I get from Patreon to calculate the gross and net costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR – it costs me money so please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/join/lukealexdavis&quot;&gt;becoming a patreon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: unfortunately, as I&apos;m not an accountant and don&apos;t have one, these figures won&apos;t be exact due to currency conversion (I get paid in dollars from Patreon so my final conversion will be after deductions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in 2020, according to my IONOS invoices, I have spent &lt;strong&gt;£174.66 inc. VAT&lt;/strong&gt;. Those costs are made up of domain names (new and renewals) and monthly web hosting fees (which used to be quarterly but recently changed). I was stunned. That&apos;s a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of Patreon income, in 2020 so far, I have made $134.01 of which I donated $63 to Black charities. That brings the net income to $71.01 which is &lt;strong&gt;£54.16&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means I come out with &lt;strong&gt;-£120.50&lt;/strong&gt; and 2020 isn&apos;t finished yet. This is why I&apos;ve ramped up the requests for donations and Patreon pledges. I love what I do but it costs me money. Besides Patreon going towards the costs for domains and web hosting, I want it to go towards my time doing it all and I&apos;d hope that the people who are and want to pledge enjoy the content as well. Most of the traffic I get is from Google searches so I never get to see or hear from those people directly. I&apos;ve increased the tweets I send out and social referral traffic is up significantly but, again, I don&apos;t really know who those people are (so thank you but feel free to chat to me about what I write for that sweet hit of validation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t like talking about money or going on and on about Patreon and nobody asks me about it but I believe in being transparent and open about it all so there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

But pandemics and outbreaks aren&apos;t a global rarity and this one has shown how the world&apos;s infrastructures and systems aren&apos;t risk tested. It&apos;s alarming how we have little choice to put and money and faith in systems that have panicked and not had a single clue what to do. Is that the epitome of capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;

I will always support Black women as long as I know they&apos;ll support me and people like me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story. The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for the Tom Brokaw news program. The reporter had been assigned a theory and was seeking sound bites to support it. “Wouldn’t you say,” she asked, “that killings like this are influenced by violent movies?” No, I said, I wouldn’t say that. “But what about ‘Basketball Diaries’?” she asked. “Doesn’t that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine gun?” The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it’s unlikely the Columbine killers saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory. “Events like this,” I said, “if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn’t have messed with me. I’ll go out in a blaze of glory.”
In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of “explaining” them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was from 2004. Has anything changed in 2020?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t be fooled by capitalist traditions. People who write books aren&apos;t the only writers in the world. Everyone is a writer but not everyone is a novelist, or a journalist, a blogger, a calligraphist, a student, a researcher, a data entry clerk, a typographer, or a teacher. When you add specificity, that&apos;s when you can exclude yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days, it was centred on discovery through search but then major corps transformed the Web into a land of online billboards and while &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; formed an anthesis, that slowly died and now we&apos;re hear, writing &quot;content&quot; that is only meaningful if it&apos;s over 1,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever asks people (now defined simply as &quot;users&quot;) their thoughts on search and the Web. Their assumed behaviour is based on whatever Google tells us and it&apos;s algorithms change their interactions rather than the other way around. That&apos;s my belief anyway. I don&apos;t have the data to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at how people have reacted to COVID-19 and their submission to governments who have openly deceived their citizens. That&apos;s leads me to the conclusion that big tech companies can change their realities to make profit and &quot;prove&quot; that what they&apos;re doing is innovative and forward thinking. If the user absolves responsibility, you can control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I blog outside of work, I actively—albeit metaphorically and morally—fight Google. I&apos;ll link to whomever I want, keep my content as short or as long as I want, ignoring the possibility of it being regarded as &quot;thin content&quot; (who the fuck are they to call it thin content anyway?) I don&apos;t have clients to please. I share things I find interesting and don&apos;t let a series of biased algorithms and Big Data tell me what interesting should mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is far from digital anarchism and I wouldn&apos;t call my blog posts forms of protest but I certainly feel better for writing what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want than what I think a multi-billion dollar enterprise will index and rank on the first page for a search query.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No idea what to talk about here besides my life since May, when I posted my last update. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blacklivesmatter.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Black Lives Matter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; took priority throughout June and most of July until I suffered social media burnout towards the end, and I’m still feeling the burn today. I log in, check notifications, and log out. I can’t bring myself to read my timeline for longer than about 5 minutes. It makes me anxious, and it’s so noisy but clearing the noise would require unfollowing a lot of people who I like and admire which I don’t want to do. It’s not their fault that I can’t handle the nature of tweets, and they’re not even about BLM or racism per se.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m just sick of the world and things that are happening with no real, sustainable evidence of changing. I felt empowered during the early months of the latest BLM wave (I still don’t know what to call it because it’s a movement that has been going on for years and it’s one of many manifestations of decades of Black civil rights). But then it turned to extreme disappointment when I saw so many people who played at activism for a few days, go back to their ignorant updates or do that liberalist thing where they exclaim shock at how bad White people in power can be as if Black people hadn’t done this for decades—let alone weeks—before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything felt like a distraction and while I knew I couldn’t and shouldn’t look to non-Black people for this kind of moral or active support (I say non-Black because a lot of non-Black POCs had shown examples of anti-Blackness alongside White people which wasn’t surprising but it pissed me off nonetheless), it left a bad taste in my mouth. So I logged off and I’ve not felt a great need to come back in the same way I had before. I don’t know whether I will. I almost don’t want to. I want to be able to talk, speak to only the people who talk to me, and leave. Lists serve that purpose but it’s whether I can be bothered to log in to make that work. We’ll see.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For now, I’m just blogging. I have a backlog of ideas to blog about and I’ve really got into it this weekend. Over the last week or so, I finally got into &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)&quot;&amp;gt;Halt and Catch Fire&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a series that examined the computing boom of the 80s and the Internet Age of the 90s. The acting was superb and I particularly enjoyed the parts about the Internet, the Web, and search (as that’s my job and a great passion of mine). Then, I listened back to a podcast episode with my favourite blogger, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org&quot;&amp;gt;Jason Kottke&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. I’d temporarily postponed him (not quite a cancellation) after a post that rubbed me up the wrong way but he put me onto Halt and Catch Fire (as he appeared in it for a brief scene) and I’ve modelled my blogging style on his over the last year or so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And now I’m here. Turns out I did know what to talk about after all. As always, please check out the links below to my blogs and Patreon which financially supports them all. Maybe one day I can do this blogging thing full time as if it’s the 00s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks and take care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;—Luke&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And given her history with misattributed quotes, I&apos;m inclined to think she &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;didn&apos;t&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; say this. But that doesn&apos;t stop it from being interesting:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot;I’ve learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.&quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought about how I would react in those situations and it does say a lot about me: calm except when I&apos;m incredibly anxious because someone asked me to do something specific in those situations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep having to remind myself that it isn&apos;t tiring being &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/black/&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;s tiring fighting white supremacy. That&apos;s where the exhaustion lies. Day-to-day engagement with and battling against a system put in place to dehumanise and murder Black people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this sounds like a simple and reasonable request. But because white supremacy permeates everything about our lives, it involves constant dodging alongside other bigoted manifestations like at the micro and macro level. It fucking sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&apos;re learning, good for you but I don&apos;t care right now. I won&apos;t be marking your exam paper. Do that work to the day you die and leave me out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run 5 blogs as &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/blogs-and-hats/&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;. I effectively run them all on my own and the topics I cover are the opposite of niche:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music (but mostly sampling) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Sampleface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture - &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Cultrface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STEM (science, tech, engineering, and maths) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;LOGiCFACE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sports - &lt;a href=&quot;https://playrface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Playrface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming - &lt;a href=&quot;https://distantarcade.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Distant Arcade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of sites who cover them individually and collectively. You&apos;ll probably know them well and you&apos;ll also know they have teams of hundreds, if not thousands of writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am on my own, trying to compete with them on Google. At first, I wrote whatever I wanted. Then I got serious but lost motivation to write. Then I got my mojo back to write whatever and now I&apos;m back with wanting to write about specific things with &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/seo/&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; (search engine optimisation) in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind and goals keep flitting between the two and I&apos;m constantly trying to find a medium all the while knowing I&apos;m on my own. I don&apos;t ask for help because I can&apos;t afford to pay anyone and I don&apos;t feel comfortable asking people to write for free, especially now. So I update when I can, wondering how much better they could all be if things were different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should write something then.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>This is my content creation flow</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/</guid><description>Here is how I create content</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I &quot;revealed&quot; my content creation flow on Twitter (as if it was a secret) and I said I&apos;d write about it in more detail. So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools of the trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I&apos;m prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I use are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com/en/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raindrop.io/&quot;&gt;Raindrop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in/&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org/&quot;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use &lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Colab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress &lt;s&gt;and Grav&lt;/s&gt;, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay £3/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I&apos;ll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, it costs me about £140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can&apos;t update everything as regularly as I&apos;d like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don&apos;t want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a special Python script to decide what to write about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don&apos;t write about it, I just put the link on there)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Python script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it&apos;s purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.raindrop.io/collections/&quot;&gt;Raindrop has its own API&lt;/a&gt; which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my Collections. Here&apos;s the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import requests
import random

headers = {&apos;Authorization&apos;: &apos;Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE&apos;}

r = requests.get(
&apos;https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens&apos;, headers=headers)

response = r.json()

raindrop_list = []

for num in range(0,len(response[&quot;items&quot;])):
	count = response[&quot;items&quot;][num][&quot;count&quot;]
	title = response[&quot;items&quot;][num][&quot;title&quot;]
	title_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))
	raindrop_list.append(title_count)
	raindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]

rand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)
print(raindrop[rand])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll explain each line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; gives me access to the API and &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; is for the random pick, which I&apos;ll explain in a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;raindrop_list&lt;/code&gt; is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. &lt;code&gt;(&apos;Food &amp;amp; Drink&apos;, 7)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; and the title in &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;title_count&lt;/code&gt; creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code&gt;title_count&lt;/code&gt; gets added to &lt;code&gt;raindrop_list&lt;/code&gt; and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called &lt;code&gt;raindrop&lt;/code&gt; which gets rid of all the empty Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I create a random integer between 0 and &lt;code&gt;len(raindrop_list)-1&lt;/code&gt; and use that as the random index of &lt;code&gt;raindrop&lt;/code&gt; which gets printed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sense? Probably not as that&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don&apos;t get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a flow that works for me and I&apos;m almost certain it won&apos;t work for anyone else. That&apos;s because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don&apos;t have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you&apos;re done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just... stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I&apos;m done.&lt;/p&gt;

All the news and rumours and hysteria and jokes about COVID-19 are getting too much and it&apos;s downright depressing. I&apos;m annoyed by the response to the virus from the government and other authorities that directly affect me. Peoples&apos; lives aren&apos;t the primary concern and it&apos;s disgusting and very telling. But that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m also not feeling 100% (don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not the virus) and I&apos;m &quot;self-isolating&quot; this weekend. All I&apos;ve done today is watch YouTube and occasionally eaten and drunk but I do need to drink more. By doing that, I&apos;ve ignored everything on TV and social media and it&apos;s reminded me that future isolation won&apos;t be so bad for me. I also realised that I have a high level of privilege for feeling that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time published an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5801897/women-affected-covid-19/&quot;&gt;Why the Coronavirus Outbreak Could Hit Women Hardest&lt;/a&gt; discussing the harmful effects of isolation from the virus for women at risk from domestic violence. It&apos;s a subsection of society most of us - including me - won&apos;t have thought about. There are also people most at risk of catching the virus and suffering further health complications. COVID-19 has already killed nearly 6,000 people at the time of writing. As I sit in my flat, I think of all those people. I should do that more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, most people change the styling of their links and that disables &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;a:visited&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. Purple is the default colour for the selector but that might not always work for your layout. It works for me though. The only issue is I don&apos;t like &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;that&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; purple. So I looked for the Pantone colour created in honour of Prince when he passed away in 2016 and I now use that on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/&quot;&gt;my main site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shade I use is &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;#9663C4&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; but from the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/connect/PQ-7448C&quot;&gt;Pantone PQ-7448C&lt;/a&gt; page, it&apos;s &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;#4B384C&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the below code to add it to your stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Prince purple version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a:visited {
    color: #9663C4;
}

// The Pantone PQ-7448C version

a:visited {
    color: #4B384C;
}

// Or the CSS custom variables option

:root {
    --princepurple: #9663C4;
}

a:visited {
    color: var(--princepurple);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that opening gambit wasn&apos;t bad enough, I forced myself to read the rest. Apparently the reason poor people make bad decisions is because &quot;living in poverty overwhelms their brains, decreasing cognitive ability by a significant amount&quot;. But it got worse. Two studies were quoted, both taking place in India and the USA (the latter looking at Cherokee families).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this classist, ableist, and racist crap? And what about the rich people who make notably poor decisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s look at five of the richest men (in wealth and influence):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff Bezos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&apos;ve all made some pretty awful decisions in their time. Especially heinous, you might say. Were they attributed to decreased cognitive ability? No. It was all risk-taking, followed by resilience and admiration for getting back on the horse and trying again. They also had a shitload of money and privilege behind them. Those five men have had the luxury to make bad choices - which have affected people&apos;s lives - and get away with them. Look at Elon Musk calling someone a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/unsworth-vs-musk-pedo-guy-defamation-trial-verdict.html&quot;&gt;&quot;pedo guy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, being taken to court for defamation, and &lt;em&gt;getting off&lt;/em&gt;. Or Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook as a &quot;hot or not&quot; comparison site and then not bothering to fact check political ads? Jack Dorsey allowing fascists to roam free on Twitter while allowing victims face bans for fighting back. Or Jeff Bezos being absolute scum. Etc. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final paragraph talks about Bregman&apos;s advocacy for a universal basic income (UBI), a 15-hour work-week, and open borders. It comes from his book &lt;em&gt;Utopia for Realists&lt;/em&gt; and that&apos;s all well and good but then I saw a quote from the NYT calling Bregman &quot;a more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell&quot;. Yuck. That&apos;s all I need to know. You can keep the book and the ideology. What you can do instead is listen to people of colour who have spoken at length for decades about the struggles their respective people have faced and what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

My head is never cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each one, I get the following feeling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Sampleface&lt;/a&gt;: hard hat - writing reviews of any kind is difficult as I struggle to find words to describe music. More &quot;generic&quot; stuff is easier to write about so I gravitate towards that when I update the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Cultrface&lt;/a&gt;: wide brim fedora - I get more excited about writing for Cultrface because the gamut is so wide. The only thing that stops me from updating it more is the the thing that stops me from writing in general. Well, &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;: fatigue, procrastination, anxiety, depression, the fact I can&apos;t churn out amazing content in 5 minutes so what&apos;s the point. The usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;LOGiCFACE&lt;/a&gt;: chullo - I need to be in the mood to write about STEM. It&apos;s definitely not a lack of ideas, just a lack of motivation and mood. I actually get traffic for some niche topics so the impetus &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be there. But for reasons why it isn&apos;t, see above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://playrface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Playrface&lt;/a&gt;: Nike Dri-fit Head Tie, I get a similar feeling writing for Playrface as I do for Cultrface despite lacking critical or technical knowledge of sport. I know what I know and most of it is about tennis and soccer. Anything else I&apos;m just curious and write about those curiosities. Most of the content is about &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/&quot;&gt;Federer&lt;/a&gt; or Championship Manager and the latter brings in the most traffic. Go figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other blogs. They rarely get updated due to extreme versions of the above problem. And this one just gets random musings when I can be bothered. Like this one. No hat required. Just words.&lt;/p&gt;

That shit fascinates me. I fell down the internet rabbit hole in 2000 so I missed the first 10 years of the Web but from everything I&apos;ve picked up over the years, it was a remarkable time. All I need is a massive windfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was funny to read in retrospect because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s from 2003 which isn&apos;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; far away but it feels that way if you read this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It pretty much says &quot;hey, I found out about this thing called &apos;codeswitching&apos;. Have you heard of it?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s something minorities do to get some privacy and peace and has been going on for centuries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wamu.org/story/18/09/12/ready-for-a-linguistic-controversy-say-mhmm/&quot;&gt;thanks slavery and oppression!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it became a &quot;thing&quot; to media publications in the 2010s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve codeswitched in different ways since I was 6. I had to adopt a different accent to stop kids asking me to say words in my Northern accent. I kept it up for about 15 years with only a couple of slips and explanations when they heard me. I did it when I lived in Atlanta for the same reason. I do it with my mum, switching between Jamaican and English, as does she. It puts a point across better when you do it and it&apos;s the closest I&apos;ll get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk/2-polyglots-have-an-awesome-chat-in-21-languages/&quot;&gt;calling myself a polyglot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But what have I learnt? I wrote a list of 19 things I&apos;&apos;ve picked up over that period.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/eight/&quot;&gt;I wrote about my journey in digital marketing&lt;/a&gt; when I got my job. Here is what I&apos;ve learnt in my first year as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Women in SEO are the best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren&apos;t white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It&apos;s the best decision I&apos;ve ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I&apos;m grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experts aren&apos;t experts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won&apos;t name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen a lot of &quot;expert&quot; opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I&apos;m not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn&apos;t have a place in search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There&apos;s still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn&apos;t see any people like me. It didn&apos;t bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I&apos;m &quot;in&quot;, I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word &quot;diversity&quot; now as it&apos;s lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that&apos;s how capitalism works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s still a sexism problem. It&apos;s not as bad as it used to be but there&apos;s still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;brightonSEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://brightonseo.com/&quot;&gt;brightonSEO&lt;/a&gt; one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I&apos;m going again this year, with more experience under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year&apos;s being just as good if not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keywords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It&apos;s about topics, not individual keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade and most of the time, I don&apos;t write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical SEO is my strong suit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I&apos;ve honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that&apos;s where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python is amazing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know HTML isn&apos;t a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;. I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn&apos;t for me. And now I hate C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I&apos;ve already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/&quot;&gt;Python&apos;s potential in paid search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript is overused&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it&apos;s just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn&apos;t the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I&apos;m not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn&apos;t the solution to everything on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;APIs are amazing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything APIs can&apos;t do? Actually, don&apos;t answer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself &quot;does this have an API&quot; and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pokeapi.co/&quot;&gt;Pokémon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They&apos;re a great way to practise in your language of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use headings more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they&apos;re not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don&apos;t help with ranking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The inverted pyramid model is a good idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html&quot;&gt;The inverted pyramid model&lt;/a&gt; is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you&apos;ll read more. I&apos;ve heard naysayers claim TL;DR&apos;s kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/&quot;&gt;featured snippets&lt;/a&gt;), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they&apos;re ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There&apos;s a lot of the same content out there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I found an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/&quot;&gt;Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out&lt;/a&gt; and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you’ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, “SEO content” has become a synonym for meandering “ultimate guides” and formulaic “7 ways” listicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analysing the SERPs for intent, we&apos;re told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the &quot;best&quot; content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there&apos;s more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there&apos;s a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Internal linking is important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn&apos;t know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you&apos;re writing good content that links to more good content, you&apos;re going to keep a user on your site. And if it&apos;s an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So is a good architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else I didn&apos;t pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/&quot;&gt;Crawl depth&lt;/a&gt; is an issue (I&apos;m working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google is not a meritocracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/&quot;&gt;I wrote a piece on this&lt;/a&gt;] so I won&apos;t repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But John Mueller is awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, if you&apos;re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I love the Web even more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School&apos;s library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it&apos;s used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I love not doing SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those &quot;best practices&quot;. Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/&quot;&gt;it&apos;s not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to write about something, I&apos;ll write about it. There&apos;s no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured &quot;for Google&quot;. My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don&apos;t rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won&apos;t let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shout outs&lt;/h2&gt;

Then I couldn&apos;t save it, thought I&apos;d copied everything and when I reloaded the page, somehow only got one paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have this. It&apos;s still about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4h9xcdtyrE&quot;&gt;Bad Boys&lt;/a&gt; - which I watched tonight and enjoyed for the 10th time - but not in the same way. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/letterboxd-diaries/#2020&quot;&gt;I logged it in Letterboxd&lt;/a&gt; and noticed there have been multiple films made called Bad Boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filmaffinity.com/us/film372179.html&quot;&gt;Bad Boys (1961)&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/japan/&quot;&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; film about &quot;a young delinquent who takes part in a robbery and is sentenced to a juvenile detention centre, where he clashes with other youths and reflects on his life experiences&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRILgwNJNkI&quot;&gt;Bad Boys (1983)&lt;/a&gt; - A similar film (is it a Western remake?) about a delinquent sent to a juvenile detention centre starring Sean Penn, Clancy Brown, and Ally Sheedy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad Boys (2003) - A Finnish &quot;true story&quot; with four topless white men on the cover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad Boys (2014) - A documentary about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFa4BChz5w&quot;&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might watch the one about the Detroit Pistons. Probably gonna skip the Finnish one.&lt;/p&gt;

It started with a sneeze on Thursday, then turned into a phlegmy throat, and it descended from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has totally wiped me out. On the plus side, I&apos;ve been able to catch up on my YouTube Watch Later playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m currently struggling to get to sleep. My body aches but my mind is wired. A metaphysical dilemma. But I&apos;d prefer to be in a better physical state. (See what I did there?)&lt;/p&gt;

Can it be worn like a winter coat or a pair of cool sunglasses? Does it give owners freedom of their cities?</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is it a closed question? Can it be worn like a winter coat or a pair of cool sunglasses? Does it give owners freedom of their cities? Can it even be explained in a length of text? Blackness is everything and it is nothing. It is a weaponised concept and it is a blanket of community. In the right hands, those tired hands passed down by ancestors, it can revolt and rejoice through the pain of its history. In the wrong hands, those clean hands of oppressors, its coloured connotations are brought to the forefront; darkness, blacklisted, blacked out, evil. It is misconstrued as a binary system - the one drop rule has never died, just changed its visage. There is no percentage competition with &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/black/&quot;&gt;blackness&lt;/a&gt; but it is used as such. What is “HALF-caste” really? There are gradients to this rhetoric but blackness isn’t a rhetoric. No one can “speak” in Blackness as a single entity for the truth is blackness is composed of numerous planes. The fact I speak of Blackness now in this language – my native tongue – betrays its true origins and yet represents its history so well. The English language is a melting pot of others, tracing centuries of raping and pillaging from other lands, taking words and refashioning them as “loan words” that have never been returned (much like artefacts of Blackness on those English language museums). The words I utter to describe this unfathomably large concept were given to my ancestors by force but without those words, I could not sit down to speak of Blackness. What a conundrum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I must refine them. I must celebrate the champions of Blackness from centuries ago, in the present, and what lies in the future. For those who suffered, suffer, and will suffer after me. It is crucial to inform that Blackness is not a proportion of melanin. Skin colour is a vice we all hold but it is not a defining rod or rule of judgement. Blackness transcends this all. But I am not equipped to be that judge. There are anthologies of work that can do better than me. I am merely a sentence worth. But with one sentence comes another, into a paragraph, a page, a chapter, a book, a series, a shelf, a library. This is the power of Blackness. To start from so small, under the foot of the oppressors and shout what we feel and what should be heard. This is what fuels movements like Black Lives Matter – because they all matter and this is why. The anger you see and hear? It is valid and necessary. It cannot be destroyed or extinguished as that would break the laws of the conservation of energy, laws we all follow. Covering up blackness is futile. Weaponising it has consequences, more severe with time. For those who suffer them (and I loathe to use the word “suffer” in this context), they must learn the hard way. But it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I have rambled. The truth is I cannot define blackness into a neat dictionary term. That would be the most heinous crime; an assault committed by oppressors who point to the book to prove they aren’t racist. But that book is written by them. “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house” said Audre Lorde. How can we determine whether the tools of Black people are truly ours or those of the master? That perhaps is another question and another I cannot answer. But we can certain refrain from using the most overt devices. Repurpose and refresh. We have achieved relative success in the form of language. I admire the reversal of meaning in the English language. It fascinates and saddens me in equal measure. The sadness comes from its use by non-Black people to attack or profit. Or complete ignorance in the form of active erasure. Why should Chaucer and Shakespeare be lauded and rappers be denigrated? They are modern-day griots and their stories use said master’s tools with such brilliance to attack them.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been a while since I’ve written a blog post. Sometimes I feel like writing but the motivation leaves me like air from a balloon. But this is worthy of prose. I’ll start from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University is full of clichés: students never wash, never show up for lectures, waste their maintenance grants, eat nothing but super noodles, party all night, cram last minute, scrape 2:1s and 2:2s. The end. Some or all may apply to some or all students. Some applied to me. My first attempt at a university degree ended after 6 months. My official line was “it wasn’t how I expected”. I’d picked computer science because I didn’t think I’d make it as a graphic designer. The truth was external voices made me think that. I stopped focussing on everything in college by my final year. I didn’t get the grades I should have. I put too much emphasis on creating a social life and a pseudo-extroverted version of myself. That also played a part in my aborted stint at university. It all stopped by the time I was 22/23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my second attempt was successful. I tried for a graphic design degree but the interviewer suggested a foundation course. My other option was a 3-year music technology degree. No interview required. It combined the technological aspect from computer science and, of course, music. My choice was obvious. First year was a breeze but second year was more serious. I needed to try and make connections before I left. In the summer, I got in touch with a record label looking for a digital media assistant. Coincidentally, a long-time friend was also working there. They invited me to the office and I got thrown in the deep end. I arrived with full blown &lt;a href=&quot;/recortes/hay-fever-haiku/&quot;&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt; symptoms. My nose was streaming and I was running out of tissues fast. But I survived and I got the job. I spent the next year there between lectures and seminars. It started out with admin and later progressed into blog writing and ad-hoc design work. I became a jack of all trades and enjoyed working with friends and laughter. I was living the dream. But all good things must come to an end and they did. The company was haemorrhaging money. Wages weren’t paid, solicitors came, friends left. I didn’t pursue legal action but I left after a week of non-payment and never went back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stole one of their Twitter accounts as moral payback and transformed it into something of my own. But before I left, I started work on a blog and called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk&quot;&gt;Sampleface&lt;/a&gt;. The name came from a friend who used it to describe the face you make when you hear a song you think you could sample. We worked on it together and after we all parted ways, I continued writing for it. I enjoyed immersing myself in the music and the writing. Music had saved me from spiralling depression I’d developed at uni the first time. It was all so cathartic and exciting. But I couldn’t find any paid work in a similar way. I graduated with a 2:1 and went on to work in a post office. I kept writing. My then-girlfriend helped and organised interviews with artists. I got to speak to some of my idols and even met one for a face-to-face interview on my birthday weekend. I’ll never forget that. But then the writing slowed down.
A seed of doubt was planted in my mind and it never stopped growing. I was asked why I was doing what I was doing if there were other people doing the same thing. As someone who sucks at defending themselves, I didn’t have a clear answer so I said nothing. And I let it get to me. Then I found a full-time job where my girlfriend lived and I moved up to Nottingham. I was drifting away from what I felt I should be doing. But I needed to eat and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I kept on writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the odd freelance project here and there. Interviews that amounted to nothing. I tried but maybe not hard enough. There was time off work for stress and anxiety. A new baby on the way. Arguments and increased stress and anxiety. 2015 was hell for me. 2016 wasn’t much better. My son was the only thing I lived for after he was born. But I still wrote when I found the time. And then a big life change. I moved out on my own. Writing was a weekly thing if I was lucky. It used to be a daily thing. By 2017, I’d been writing for Sampleface for 5 years. I’d started a couple more blogs in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend contacted me about a possible freelance project. And paid. I was working part time and the money came in handy. It also meant some writing experience. I used some of the money to go on holiday for my birthday week. It was one of the greatest weeks of my life. I found a new flat. I did a digital marketing course and passed. I was “qualified” now. 2017 felt like hell but in hindsight it was a positive year. 2018 wasn’t. There were more rejections, doubts over my direction, work was eating away at me. I needed to get out but nobody wanted me. I moved departments and that helped but it wasn’t enough. New year came, I stayed in. I didn’t make any new year’s resolutions. “Que sera, sera” as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then another breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shopping in Wilko of all places and I got a call. It was a mobile number I didn’t recognise and I assumed it was an agency. I’d had a million calls from agencies amounting to nothing and hesitated. But I answered. A company were looking for a copywriter. It would involve writing about online gambling. The freelance project I worked on in 2017 was all about online gambling. This was great but I played it down. I made this my last chance. First interview went well, or as well as I think it could have. That’s the problem with interviews – you can think it went okay and then you don’t get it. They called me back for a second interview and asked me to complete a task. The second interview felt worse than the first. I panicked for the rest of the day thinking I’d blown it. But I hadn’t. I got the call to say I got the job. I didn’t know what to say. The waiting and working had finally paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I realised something. Every move I’d made, post I’d written, people I’d spoken to – they had all lead me here. It often feels like a cliché to say everything you do leads you to where you are but it’s true. I felt pangs of regret that I hadn’t pursued maths at college, at least with serious intent. I felt like my degree was a waste. But it lead me to this job. Had I not studied, I wouldn’t have looked for the job at the label. I wouldn’t have made music, wouldn’t have started the blog, made friends with the guy who put me onto the freelance project that gave me the experience that helped me get the job. It all linked. I’m reading this back and wondering if this is all too flowery; self-indulgent. Congratulations, you got a job, what’s the big deal? Well, it is a big deal to me. I put myself down way too much. But now’s the time to acknowledge my achievements. Why did I call this post “Eight”? Because it took me 8 years to get to where I wanted to be. I joked to a colleague that I’d made it out of Shawshank and that’s how it felt. who I crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side (metaphorically of course). I finally had an answer to the question I couldn&apos;t answer. I’ve been writing for Sampleface now for 7 years this year. It’s not as popular as it used to be but I still write. Nothing will stop me writing bar a loss of upper extremities. I like to inform, to exhibit, and to teach. And it gets me where I need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

But the more followers you get, the more you&apos;re likely to follow. The &quot;following:follower&quot; ratio (which I will call F:f from now on) means more than it should to outsiders looking in. If F:f is 1: more than or equal to 1 (more than or equal to 1), you&apos;re not deemed as popular compared to an F:f ratio of 1:less than 1 (less than 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following: 1028, Followers: 521; F:f = 1:0.506&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a brand, likely they started by following loads of accounts. Some followed back. Others are bots/accounts who follow back regardless of who you are. Customers might see this and assume the brand isn&apos;t popular or otherwise chasing it. This is superficial on face value. Content is more important. There are examples where the ratio can flag untoward behaviour. Check out the links below under &lt;strong&gt;Resources and further reading&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following: 231, Followers: 2106; F:f = 1:8.272&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a big ratio towards followers. Without further investigation, this account and brand/person is popular. They might have bought followers or loads of bots decided to feast on the content carcass on offer. But who has time to check that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a temptation to fixate on the mystical F:f ratio. But you also want to keep abreast of your industry through many accounts. If only there was a way to meet halfway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact there is and it uses an age old Twitter feature: &lt;strong&gt;lists&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is make a table of three columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those you follow who follow back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those you follow who don&apos;t follow back but whose content holds some merit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those you follow only through some kind of &quot;obligation&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write this down or create a spreadsheet (mmm, spreadsheets!). There&apos;s no official way to export following lists but &lt;a href=&quot;https://ask.metafilter.com/321093/Can-I-export-import-people-I-follow-on-Twitter-to-new-account#4630639&quot;&gt;this is a decent albeit convoluted alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have some tough decisions to make. Most of us fear unfollowing someone and them returning the favour. You lose a follower and wonder if they&apos;ll be offended. But this is YOUR timeline. If you don&apos;t want them there, they don&apos;t have to be. Of course, you could &quot;relegate&quot; them to their own list but we&apos;ll get to that shortly. Once you&apos;ve compartmentalized everyone, create your lists on Twitter. On a spiritual level, I believe everything we do and experience is based on energy transfer; unfollowing and moving accounts to list follows the same principle. There&apos;s still a connection but it&apos;s a little different. But rather than keep accounts on a list like dusty pig ornaments in a glass cabinet, use them. Lists are basically organised timelines. If you need some inspiration for a certain topic, tap into the relevant list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a more ordered following list, you can receive more necessary content and more accounts are grouped in lists. And it looks good to people who live and die by the F:f ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some of my favourites.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not owned many Sony products but I&apos;ve always admired their design. Here are some of my favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MiniDisc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve always wanted a MiniDisc Walkman ever since I saw my cousin with one. Obsolete is an understatement for this technology but still cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony Xperia phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owned the Xperia Z5 but this model isn&apos;t far from it in terms of design. Simple and sleek, just how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walkman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had the CD Walkman with &quot;shock protection&quot; but the original can&apos;t be beaten. It&apos;s an iconic design and still works wonders if you can find a working model on eBay. Play your cassettes with ease and stay wired for sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playstation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got to own the PSone but I did have the original PlayStation and the PS2. The official controller is a work of ergonomic art and the PSone is wonderful and compact, in its soft grey shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony ⍺&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sony Alpha, or ⍺, looks incredible. I own a Canon but I wouldn&apos;t say no to one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony Cyber-shot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens. If you saw a digital photo from the 00s, it was probably taken with a Cybershot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xperia Tablet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the Zperia tablet I own but the range is great. It&apos;s not my #1 tablet range (that accolade belongs to the Google Nexus tablet  family) but it comes in at a close second with Sony&apos;s trademark polished look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory Stick Pro Duo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite as obsolete as the MiniDisc but not far off. I don&apos;t know why I like this periphery so much but the typography is great. That&apos;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m currently learning Portuguese and brushing up on Spanish and French on Duolingo and my reading is much better than my speaking. But what if you had impaired sight and needed to use a screen reader. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox5QVbZSPBk&quot;&amp;gt;Foreign languages written on English websites are read in English voices as if they were English words&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. That&apos;s no good to a foreign language speaker. But there is a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In HTML, there&apos;s a lang attribute that allows you to set a page&apos;s language and, if you need to, add the language to any number of words or sentences for others. When I wrote this article, I had to write something in Portuguese. I added the following code to the paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span lang=&quot;pt&quot;&amp;gt;O Sexto&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then added some style to it with CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:lang(pt) { 
    font-style: italic;
	color: #00661a;
	border-bottom: 1px solid #ff0017;
}```

The colours were just for fun but it&apos;s a great way for those learning the language to be able to differentiate words and practise while those who require screen readers can understand what is written in their mother tongue.

For more info on the lang attribute, check out a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang&quot;&amp;gt;full explanation on Mozilla&apos;s MDN database&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_lang.asp&quot;&amp;gt;CSS :lang() Selector on W3Schools&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang&quot;&amp;gt;how to style them on the W3 website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will be about two things. The first is my new musical obsession, Khruangbin. I was put onto them by a Black Milk recommendation. Their new album &lt;a href=&quot;https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/album/con-todo-el-mundo-excluding-n-s-america&quot;&gt;Con Todo El Mundo&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best of the year in my opinion and I found a video of a live gig they did for Pitchfork. A week later and I&apos;ve watched/listened to it 19 times. I am OBSESSED. They&apos;re just incredible musicians and pull from inspirations around the world which has inspired me to look for world music myself. Rather than wax lyrical about them, I&apos;ll drop the video below for you to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I wanted to talk about is &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/&quot;&gt;Federer&lt;/a&gt;. After Nadal&apos;s &quot;supernatural&quot; 11th Roland Garros title win on Sunday, attention lies back with the World #2 Roger Federer as he aims to grab his #1 spot back and retain his Wimbledon title. He&apos;s in Stuttgart for the Mercedes Cup this week and should he reach the final, he&apos;ll be back on top for his 310th week. But I&apos;m worried he won&apos;t emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players &quot;fall back&quot; on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I&apos;m probably being premature as I&apos;ve not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I&apos;m unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he&apos;s 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible. Ultimately, he&apos;s past the moment he should be dominant so I&apos;m trying to be grateful he&apos;s even playing, let alone defending &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/roger-federer-numbers-game/&quot;&gt;grand slam titles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4xKvHANqjk&quot;&gt;Khruangbin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpLSW47MPQ&quot;&gt;Federer&lt;/a&gt; at their best below.&lt;/p&gt;

I run about 6 others and I&apos;m still active on those but I tweet mostly from @lukealexdavis. It&apos;s not the first time I&apos;ve taken a break but I&apos;ve decided not to deactivate this time. Why am I drawing more attention to this? Because I&apos;m tired. Whether it&apos;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_scandal&quot;&gt;Windrush scandal&lt;/a&gt;, Kanye being a right-wing sympathiser, or Bill Cosby and Nas apologists, there are people who have suffered or are suffering and people out there defending them. And I&apos;m tired of all of it. I&apos;m very vocal about race on my account because I&apos;ve been subjected to my own relative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my biggest bugbear right now is seeing all these issues take place and the dominant voices being white and cis. And if you call for anything else, you&apos;re &quot;censoring&quot;. God forbid they should just shut up for once and let a member of the group being marginalised speak. I wouldn&apos;t mind but many with privilege don&apos;t even use it to speak up for those who suffer, instead deciding to make their own opinions, steal those of the disenfranchised, or play down their suffering (and then calling them out for discrimination when they get called out). And they wonder why we&apos;re angry or upset (I say &quot;we&quot; as a cis &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/black/&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; man and the relative discrimination I face in as a member of that demographic only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intentions here are not selfish. This is more of a call to those in those privileged groups to think about what you say and how you say it when it comes to members of other social groups who suffer discrimination. I often say I&apos;m not some kind of expert and learn how to be better everyday. It&apos;s not about political correctness (a terribly misused phrase), it&apos;s about genuine equality and letting people live without fear of persecution. Amplify voices rather than talking over them. Listen instead of talking. Question those around you rather than enabling. They&apos;re things I learn to do everyday and if we all did, we&apos;d be on the road to a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

The dynamic duo of Kid Fury and Crissle give me unadulterated life and joy. But other than their wit and advice, their presentation is an underrated element of the show. Episodes are broken up into sections much like any other podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Excellence&lt;/strong&gt; where Kid Fury picks someone in the Black community to celebrate. One that has accomplished something that is worthy of high recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Tops&lt;/strong&gt;, previously Sick Sad World, also selected by Kid Fury (the segment has undergone several other name changes, including Hot Topics, Shade In Full, and the fan favorite, &quot;Bitch, You Guessed It!!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listener Letters&lt;/strong&gt; as curated by Crissle (the segment is changed to Listener Questions when done during a live show)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Read&lt;/strong&gt; where Kid Fury and Crissle &quot;read&quot; (African American gay slang for giving one&apos;s harsh opinion) a person or topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four sections cover a period of around 2 hours. You don&apos;t even notice the time disappearing such is their ability to captivate. But what does this have to do with blogging? Well, the format can translate into your blog posts if you&apos;re running out of ideas. The debate over word counts, long vs short form, impacts on &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/tech/seo/&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; and so on will continue forever but what you write needs to fulfill a purpose for the reader. A 1000 word essay doesn&apos;t automatically win over a 200 word piece because it has more content. Trying new ways of presentation can open new doors to new readers and potentially gain a fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s look at those four sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black Excellence → Celebration of achievements in your sector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you work, you&apos;ll be part of a wider community. It can help both you and the community to share the love and appreciation. From a personal perspective, I have Google Alerts set up with specific keyword terms and share stories relevant to my blogs. I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific &quot;excellence&quot; series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you&apos;ve mentioned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot Tops → Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listener Letters → Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an &quot;agony aunt&quot; column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Read → Opinion pieces, rants, critiques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I&apos;ve had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn&apos;t write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is &lt;strong&gt;paramount&lt;/strong&gt; here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I&apos;ve written pieces on cultural appropriation and it&apos;s important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don&apos;t feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn&apos;t be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier. Linking the two together will add more link juice which is a SEO&apos;s dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other format suggestions? Comments aren&apos;t working so if you do, email me and I&apos;ll add them to this article. And go check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisistheread.com&quot;&gt;The Read&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won&apos;t do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there&apos;s no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that&apos;s a vast improvement on 2016, the &lt;strong&gt;Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accepting My Mental Health Problems and Getting Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a mathematician at heart, I like to think of things in analytical terms. Using a scale of 0-10, I&apos;d give this year an average of 3 and a variance of 5. There have been peaks but plenty of troughs and it&apos;s been hell trying to navigate through them. Anyone who follows me on Twitter will have seen my tweets on mental health and some on my own personal life. Despite this, I find it difficult to write about my life in this form. But here we are. People have often remarked at my cool exterior even in moments where others would feel stress. I never used to notice it but now I make sure to maintain this for my own peace of mind. Unfortunately, all that goes out of the window when I enter a stressful situation where I&apos;m tasked with resolving that turmoil. Over the last few years, I have developed anxiety laced with bouts of depression. I&apos;ve had difficulty controlling my anger during arguments and stressful situations, resorting to the foulest of comments for which I&apos;m ashamed. But anger isn&apos;t to blame. I am the sole culprit. Hitting rock bottom leaves you with two choices: stay there for good or find your way back up. I chose the latter. I self referred back to a counselling service and received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/&quot;&gt;CBT&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. I&apos;d received mixed reviews on its effectiveness but I knew it was the appropriate action for my problems. I didn&apos;t need medications and anything less than CBT (which I got last December) would have been useless. I had a lovely counsellor who listened and gave me the tools I needed and some food for thought: I needed to be more assertive. It&apos;s all a work in progress so I&apos;ll let you know at the end of 2018 how I&apos;ve been doing with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning To Be Comfortable Alone After A Breakup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the year with a breakup. It was meant to be The Relationship but it hadn&apos;t been right for a long time. I played my part and I&apos;m still haunted by some of my actions. I&apos;ve reached a comfortable plateau with that after a few torrid months in the middle of the year. But amongst all the mess, I learnt how to be okay on my own. I got my own place (more on that later) and found solace in my own space. I still feel lonely at times but then I remember what certain kinds of company I desired would mean and I came to appreciate the environment I was in. I had time to work on my own projects, make my own meals or order in, go out if/when I wanted to - living my life. It was the first time in my life I&apos;d lived on my own and I wouldn&apos;t trade it for anything right now. I don&apos;t know what the future holds for my love life. I&apos;ve often segued into relationships or had long stretches being single but yearning for someone but I&apos;ve not had that this time. Who knows what 2018 will bring. Again, I&apos;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting My Own Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first seven months of the year living with my sister. The change in environment was helpful and I&apos;m so grateful to my sister for that comfort. But I still needed to find my own place. After 6 viewings, I found something 10 minutes from my sister&apos;s house and I&apos;ve loved the place ever since. It&apos;s a first floor flat in one of the poshest areas in the city but it&apos;s been a dream to live here since I moved. The decor is simple and to my favourite colour scheme: white and grey. It can feel lonely sometimes but it&apos;s my home and welcome relief from work. I&apos;ve laughed to myself more there than I have in years. It&apos;s mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&apos;m Certified, Baby!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job hunt has been a nightmare. I&apos;ve applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I&apos;d passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we&apos;ll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I&apos;ll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I&apos;ll win the race in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Got A Break&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisbon. What a city. &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/my-week-in-lisbon/&quot;&gt;I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine&lt;/a&gt; and the week away was the best time I&apos;ve ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally &quot;be&quot;. Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I&apos;ve ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That&apos;s my new &quot;soul hub&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could &quot;Pandog Media&quot; Be The Answer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/blogging/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; for years and started &lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk&quot;&gt;Sampleface&lt;/a&gt; as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultrface.co.uk&quot;&gt;Cultrface&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicface.co.uk&quot;&gt;LOGiCFACE&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://playrface.co.uk&quot;&gt;Playrface&lt;/a&gt;. But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that&apos;s where Pandog Media came from. It&apos;s only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It&apos;s often suggested to blog in your free time if you can&apos;t get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I&apos;ve also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I&apos;m tired of that and I want that to change. I don&apos;t know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I&apos;ll take them on instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ve seen a lot of people progressing and I&apos;ve been still. It&apos;s not been a totally stationary year - I moved into my own place, went on my first solo holiday in 5 years, and got a qualification in digital marketing. But that&apos;s about it. I&apos;m still single (less said about that the better) and despite the qualification, my long term career plans remain as &quot;plans&quot; despite efforts to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://observer.com/2016/02/how-to-invest-in-yourself/&quot;&gt;this awesome post by Jon Westernberg&lt;/a&gt; and rather than a &quot;bucket list&quot;, it&apos;s a way to invest in yourself. My list is complete and I&apos;m ready to get to work on it. Everything is split into three categories: things that require skills, time, and things I can do right away. I&apos;ve decided to add an extra category: things that require money (because these are investments after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m working on a website for this but in the meantime, you can find the list on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PrJ6Xe9bisJD9phiwR1O7hSbZCaIaa9Qs4jh50Fqvj4/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone wants to help out in any way, I&apos;d be more than grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to feel really empowered and inspired when I worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;my music&lt;/a&gt; or wrote for &lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Sampleface&lt;/a&gt; until one day I was questioned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s the point in doing it if other people are doing the same thing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sensitive soul like me who takes rejection badly - especially when it comes from a family member - that really hurt and I&apos;ve never felt the same since. It&apos;s the classic tale of &quot;if you&apos;ve not got a natural aptitude for it, don&apos;t bother because there are better people out there and you&apos;ll never reach their heights.&quot; It hasn&apos;t stopped me completely but it has contributed to many creative ruts since. Sampleface isn&apos;t nearly as prolific as it was in the first couple of years and my music doesn&apos;t reach the same number of listeners as it did back then. Add anxiety and low self esteem to the mix and you end up with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/music/&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; - creating, listening, and writing about it. But there&apos;s always something at the back of my mind questioning whether I&apos;m just wasting my time. I don&apos;t need constant validation but because of that nagging voice in my head, it feels like I&apos;m playing songs into a void. Ultimately, it doesn&apos;t matter how many people enjoy what I do, I have to enjoy it myself otherwise there is absolutely no point in doing it. And I do. I just feel guilt beforehand and I want that to dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a life changing experience.</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon. It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I&apos;ve made in years. When I decided this, I hadn&apos;t considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March&apos;s edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://monocle.com/magazine/&quot;&gt;Monocle&lt;/a&gt;. They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation&apos;s virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I&apos;d visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday - Segunda-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I&apos;d travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents&apos; house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn&apos;t go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn&apos;t bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn&apos;t realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was €345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade&quot;&gt;Estadio Jose Alvalade&lt;/a&gt;. The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night&apos;s sleep in months, if not years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday - Terça-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn&apos;t included but at €7 a day, it was great value. I didn&apos;t fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I&apos;d mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I&apos;m back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html&quot;&gt;Italian Burger &amp;amp; Lobster House&lt;/a&gt;. I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday - Quarta-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn&apos;t until 7:45pm. I&apos;d picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only €0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/&quot;&gt;Museu Calouste Gulbenkian&lt;/a&gt;. There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html&quot;&gt;pasteis de nata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the first time - Lisbon&apos;s delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn&apos;t too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only €6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I&apos;d only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn&apos;t any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium&apos;s station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I&apos;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday - Quinta-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&amp;amp;M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for €3) and stayed in my room all day. I&apos;d been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn&apos;t anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn&apos;t regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe&quot;&gt;börek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn&apos;t a total waste and I got some new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday - Sexta-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maat.pt/en&quot;&gt;MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)&lt;/a&gt;. It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It&apos;s reminscient of Birmingham&apos;s Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Belém coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html&quot;&gt;Las Ficheras&lt;/a&gt;. Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday - Sábado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn&apos;t stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Belém for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berardo_Collection_Museum&quot;&gt;Museu Coleção Berardo&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Belém which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn&apos;t surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dalí and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/&quot;&gt;Este Oeste&lt;/a&gt;, a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday - Domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado (or &lt;strong&gt;MNAC&lt;/strong&gt; for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d&apos;Art de Catalunya) since entry was only €4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren&apos;t to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A €13 buffet wasn&apos;t to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I&apos;ve since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I&apos;d ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the São Sebastião station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Inglés, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for €4. That&apos;s when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday - Segunda-feira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents&apos; nearest station. Metro rides were €1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over £5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That&apos;s why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I&apos;d been in 5 years. It&apos;s definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I&apos;d love to live in the future. I wasn&apos;t able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.&lt;/p&gt;

As an introvert who works in an open office, I completely agree. The one time I worked in an open office and enjoyed it was when I was working with friends. It works if it&apos;s close knit. For call centres and the like? I hate them.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m not much of a gamer either so it wasn&apos;t too difficult to make a list of my five favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pokémon Gold/Silver (GBC, 2000)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t think anything could surpass Red/Blue/Yellow and then this came along. I was living in Atlanta when it came out but the buildup was amazing. They had display Gameboy Colors in Target and Walmart and I spent so much time on them. The series introduced some important features that still hold true today: new regions, separation of Special into Special Attack and Special Defence, day and night, breeding, but most importantly, 100 new Pokémon. It has since been remade for the DS and will be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on 22nd September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Championship Manager 01/02 (PC, 2001)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t for the life of me get into Football Manager. 01/02 holds my heart. I play with updates from the real world as not to feel too archaic and it&apos;s the last great game before the change. It&apos;s thin on the ground for realistic features but thanks to some special patches, it&apos;s not so bad. Playing it vanilla and you get some legendary players who couldn&apos;t imitate their &quot;digital&quot; careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super Mario World (SNES, 1990)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite early childhood memories (see F-Zero and Sonic 2 below). I was lucky enough to play it on a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was the best thing in the world. Riding Yoshi was like nothing I had ever done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;F-Zero (SNES, 1990)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fond childhood game. I only ever played this at my friend&apos;s house as he had a SNES and I wasn&apos;t allowed one. It&apos;s easily my favourite driving game. Incredible soundtrack, super addictive gameplay and then-state of the art graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sonic 2 (Sega Genesis, 1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas 1993. My cousins got this for their Sega Genesis. I got to play it and enjoyed every moment. I got to know Sonic before Mario (who I&apos;ve played more of in my lifetime). It&apos;s an instant classic and includes good old Myles Prower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Honorable mentions: Mario Tennis (N64), Pokémon Puzzle League (N64), Tetris (GB), Ronaldo V Football (GBC), System Shock 2 (PC), Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes (PC), Super RC Pro-Am (GB)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s got to the stage where my current max dosage of fexofenadine isn&apos;t enough. One of the best suggestions is a change in diet. Easier said than done, right? But before I give you the list, here are what histamines are and what they do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Histamines are neurotransmitters that can cause inflammatory responses when your immune system feels an imminent attack. As you may know, histamine can cause swelling in your blood vessels, allowing for white blood cells to find and attack the source in your body. This can lead to headaches, a flushed feeling, itchiness and miserable. Sound familiar?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to keep the symptoms down, try cutting down or cutting out the following histamine-rich foods:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fermented alcoholic beverages: beer, wine (including champagne), cider, mead, and sake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fermented foods and sauces: sauerkraut, vinegar, soy sauce, and yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cured meats: bacon, salami, pepperoni, luncheon meats, and hot dogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soured foods: sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, soured bread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried fruit: apricots, prunes, dates, figs, raisins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/lists/list-of-citrus-culvitars-and-hybrids/&quot;&gt;Most citrus fruits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aged cheese including goat cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts: walnuts, cashews, and peanuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegetables: avocados, eggplant, spinach, and tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoked fish and certain species of fish: mackerel, tuna, anchovies, and sardines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are also these foods and drinks that can release histamines:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bananas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cow&apos;s milk and products containing cow&apos;s milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strawberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wheatgerm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I&apos;m not a doctor and don&apos;t profess to be one so consulting your doctor would be the best solution. All diets are different and some foods are more important for your health than others so always check with a professional first. This is merely a list of foods for consideration. There are foods that can help reduce the symptoms due to their lower levels of histamines:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;green herbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fresh meat and fish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fresh fruit and veg (not on the lists above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains like rice, yeast free bread, oats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gluten-free pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;milk substitutes – coconut milk, rice milk, and almond milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;herbal teas – except green tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&apos;s also worth mentioning to avoid ready meals and foods containing preservatives. In a nutshell (but not literally of course), fresh food cooked from scratch is your best bet to avoid histamines. Again, easier said than done in this day and age but it can really help you cope through a tough season. You don&apos;t want to stay indoors all summer, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h5&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(Information obtained from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/low-histamine-diet-and-histamine-intolerance-guide&quot;&amp;gt;mindbodygreen&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/the-food-list/&quot;&amp;gt;Histamine Intolerance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. To reiterate, always consult a medical professional before undertaking changes in diet and take particular care of other allergies you may have.)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h5&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I remember where I was and what I was doing that evening and for the next few days trying to process it all. One of the most surreal weeks of my life. I&apos;d only become a fan in 2003 after watching this video but it changed my life, no exaggeration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve told this story about a million times but I&apos;m gonna tell it again. I was on the floor watching TV in my parents&apos; house. The advert had been on before but I&apos;d not really paid attention but this time I did. Because it was 2003, Michael was past his &quot;commercial prime&quot; as it were. Invincible was undersold to his standards and the allegations had ruined him along with his plastic surgery and vitiligo (perceived as skin bleaching to make himself white.) The tabloids had crushed him and he just wasn&apos;t the same. My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I&apos;d never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn&apos;t until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was &quot;WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn&apos;t human!&quot; but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn&apos;t keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life. From that very moment on, I &lt;strong&gt;NEEDED&lt;/strong&gt; that CD, I needed to see that advert again and I needed everything he made. This was before YouTube existed so I had to wait for the advert to be on TV and eventually it happened and I was awestruck again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the Number Ones album, I got Dangerous, then HIStory and the obsession continued. I started playing my mum&apos;s records when my parents were out. I&apos;d practice the Billie Jean dance routine from my sister&apos;s video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiP9kPEpZ4&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) to the point where I warped the carpets and they had to be replaced (my parents never found out the real reason why.) I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I&apos;d never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn&apos;t believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I&apos;d never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I&apos;d revered and loved so much - gone. It took a few years before I came to terms with it although to some degree, it&apos;ll always take me aback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Michael Jackson. You inspired so many with your work and your art in its purest form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fave could never.&lt;/p&gt;

Sega</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/my-new-obsession-is-sega/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/my-new-obsession-is-sega/</guid><description>I thought I’d revive this series where I talk about my latest obsession. My latest craze is Sega.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2017 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d revive this series where I talk about my latest obsession. Other obsessions have included &lt;a href=&quot;https://themovehubdotcom.wordpress.com/2018/11/21/my-footballing-magi/&quot;&gt;Andy Cole&lt;/a&gt; and Luke Cage but my latest craze is Sega. I wasn’t fortunate enough to own any Sega consoles until I was in my 20s (or any at all until my teens) but my cousins did. It was the coolest thing in the world to be able to play Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis and, 3 years later, NiGHTS into Dreams on the Sega Saturn. I always wanted a Game Gear but ended up with a Game Boy in 1998, which illustrates the longevity of Nintendo’s consoles and Sega’s downfall. My rare experiences with the Dreamcast didn’t hold the lustre of the Genesis and Saturn, despite being a superior device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega now lives comfortably in the software business and even its mascot has warmed to its new surroundings, fraternising with the old enemy on a multitude of Nintendo games – you know, that plumber? With the increased popularity of the Raspberry Pi and emulation, it’s never been simpler to play old Sega games without the need to buy the consoles. But my immersion back into this sea of Sega blue has come through their amazing soundtracks. Richard Jacques was responsible for a lot of the brilliant compositions for the mid-to-late 90s Sonic games, including Sonic R which was criticised for its misplaced music for some peculiar reason. My passion for music has resulted in “digging” for video games samples and what better place to look than Sega and their famous Sound Team. Spotify have a load of their OSTs and I stocked up for inspiration last night. It was amazing, especially reliving the NiGHTS OST which still makes me cry 20 years on.&lt;/p&gt;

This prompted the following statement from Fehnert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&apos;s the rules of airports that revert some to their school days: put your phone in this box and our laptop in that, stand here, wait there [...] People need to grow up - but so do the retailers that cater to us before lift-off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know what happened to warrant such comments but they&apos;re overzealous in my opinion. No amount of self help books can mask the turmoil of everyday life, particularly after recent events in the US, UK, and everyday across the world. Politicians show a continuous lack of awareness and spread fear amongst their citizens to keep them in control. We&apos;re constantly being told the food we eat causes any number of ailments - from dementia to cancer - and some may well contribute to that and other health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Racism is rife, the gulf between rich and poor continues to grow as well as disparity between genders, disabilities, religions. So when two adults want to engage in activities that bring them momentary joy before their holiday or business meeting or whatever they&apos;re travelling for, should they stop what they&apos;re doing and &quot;grow up?&quot; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need some downtime and relief from the world around us. Relaxation is fundamental for our mental health. Life is stressful enough as it is. I love the airport but I&apos;ve not always enjoyed the process of getting their, sorting out the bags, checking you&apos;ve got your passport, checking in, baggage drop offm boarding passes, going through customs, taking stuff out of your bags, being searched, all the incessant queueing. Where&apos;s the respite? If a man wants to use a colouring book and a woman play on her phone, &lt;em&gt;just let them&lt;/em&gt;. Who are they harming? It&apos;s not business of anyone to be telling someone how to live their lives unless they cause undue pain on others. This does not fall in that category. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, there&apos;s a spacehopper outside with my name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s when you hold onto ideas without actually putting them into place.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I read about a concept called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jessicaabel.com/idea-debt/&quot;&gt;Idea Debt&lt;/a&gt;. It’s when you hold onto ideas without actually putting them into place and as they build up, you’re left with an increasing number of unfulfilled concepts. I suffer from this badly. In my late teens, I came up with an idea for a fantasy novel. Ten years later, I still have a “binder of lore”, along with another of my ideas – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyperman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a superhero kept alive by radium gas (yes, that highly volatile, highly toxic gas). While the later was conjured from a bored Sunday afternoon and will never become anything more than a poor drawing, I’d love to make a go of the novel. But it’s not going to happen. I have more high quality ideas from the past few weeks to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My debt continues to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posited solution to all this is to work in the moment and that’s what I do. New ideas blossom pretty quickly in my head but soon take over like wild weeds. The negative connotations are on purpose; I become wrapped up and prioritise it over anything else, usually daily necessities like eating and cleaning. This wouldn’t sound so bad except my ideas &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;never go further than my own outlets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. For the music I make, I’ve been very lucky to make some money from it and received good feedback from my peers. Other than that, I get nothing other than momentary satisfaction. This adds interest to the Idea Debt but fortunately this is simple interest as it doesn’t hamper my creative desire for the next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit here thinking of all the ideas I’ve ever had and a debt that won’t go away, I wonder what would happen if I just set them free. Would one of those creative buds be better suited with someone else? I’d like to think so. As a species, we are very clingy to the products of our thoughts. We’re afraid to share them in case of theft and in some cases, I feel we’re right to do so but not always. What use is a brilliant idea if it’s not being used? Holding on tightly to an idea you’re almost certain of leaving in the corner of your mind is just a waste of brain power. Why not pass it onto someone you know and trust? If you really can’t bear to give it away, you have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what I plan to do. I will outsource the ideas I know I will never finish and be happier for the relief of the burden and know I’ve contributed to the flow of creativity in some way. That will give more time and mental space to carry on with the ideas I do wish to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to increase my creative output. I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they&apos;re worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. RKZ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I&apos;m not Grade A broke!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rkzuk.com&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/rkzuk&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/rkzuk&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rkzuk&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/rkzuk&quot;&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Arkotype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the &quot;passion project&quot; of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pokémon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arkotype.co/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arkotypeco&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Alex Stewart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart&apos;s Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780393324815&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt;, Soccernomics and The Numbers Game. I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that&apos;s how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AFHStewart&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/afhstewart&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Liam Wong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liamwong.com/book&quot;&gt;&apos;Tokyo Nights&apos; (TO:KY:OO) project&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you&apos;re looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes&apos; 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liamwong.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/liamwon9/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/liamwong&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Jer&apos;Maine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It&apos;s no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer&apos;Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of DatCode, a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitdatcode.github.io/&quot;&gt;#DatCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Nguyen Le&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/sport/roger-federer/&quot;&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I&apos;ve been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn&apos;t poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. KUMA GOLD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that&apos;s where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I&apos;ve seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can&apos;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. The Music Snobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a while since their last episode but nobody does music critique better than The Music Snobs. I feel honoured to be in contact with the team - Arthur, Isaac, Snoop and Jehan - and welcome every opportunity for a conversation about our favourite artists. Their opinions don&apos;t always align with mine but I have a great respect for them and their articulation is second to none. Forget all those publications telling you what you should think about music and just listen to these guys and who they recommend for the craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post has been on my mind for a while and seeing as it&apos;s the start of a new year, I thought it necessary to write it now while I&apos;m in a writing mood. There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I&apos;ve noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic &quot;I was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?&quot; retort. Well, what &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you expect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being &quot;misinterpreted&quot; and claiming &quot;if you don&apos;t say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid.&quot; (That&apos;s a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago. It was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen [...] She turned out to be witty and bright as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was later deleted after accusations of sexism. No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn&apos;t read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That&apos;s not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here&apos;s a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don&apos;t do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can&apos;t retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It&apos;s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there&apos;s another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there&apos;s no chance of an alternative perspective - it&apos;s just bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I&apos;ve overused that word and it&apos;s lost all meaning but it&apos;s a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it&apos;s very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it&apos;s not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who&apos;s getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I&apos;ve edited and published it. I think brevity is important for 2017 because online media in particular has suffered with linguistic saturation and an obsession with narrative. I recently wrote an unpublished article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastwordonsports.com/2017/01/13/football-is-dead/&quot;&gt;Football Is Dead&lt;/a&gt; where I rang the death knell on the sport thanks to its replacement: The Narrative. There&apos;s a lot of focus on talking and writing over the actual event and it isn&apos;t confined to the annals of sport. The news is overflowing with jargon, unnecessary words and ill-thought ideas. I&apos;ve had to block The Guardian on Twitter because the opinion pieces coming through were terrible. I couldn&apos;t believe they got past an editor, both in context and general grammar and construction. My best writing has come from an academic perspective, where both brevity and nuance are crucial tools. I wouldn&apos;t have got a First for my dissertation without them. We need those tools for what we read and hear in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won&apos;t dumb down journalistic output as some may suggest. Active writing can still flourish with care for succinctness and understanding of social differences. In fact, these ideas will bolster the messages needed. A clearly constructed message along with the follow through of action and education are vital in this fight against rising fascism. Trump and his ilk don&apos;t know the meaning of brevity and nuance. Publications like Inf0wars and Br3itbart are overflowing with offensive and confused rhetoric and because we&apos;re in a culture of more is better and they shout it the loudest, it&apos;s taken in by so many. That&apos;s not to say the direct opposite is what we need - talking quiet and saying nothing never solved anything. It&apos;s about saying and doing the considered amount with respect for the marginalised, particularly when their voice needs to be heard and not censored or quashed.&lt;/p&gt;

That&apos;s a pertinent question and something I&apos;ve often asked myself from a musical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started seriously making music in 2010 after undertaking a Music Tech course. I released 9 albums between 2011-2013. I was in the zone and enjoyed making the music, promoting it and the feedback I gained. My highlight was ranking &lt;a href=&quot;http://potholesinmyblog.com/top-25-instrumental-albums-of-2012/4/&quot;&gt;#11 in Potholes In My Blog&apos;s Top 50 Instrumental Albums list&lt;/a&gt; which I didn&apos;t see coming at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from late 2013, I hit a slump. I had less time to make music, a long distance relationship to maintain and found myself in a motivational rut. I tried forcing through it and that made it worse. Music production became repulsive to me; my body started rejecting the keys and the pads. In 2014, I released 2 albums. In 2015, just the one. Music was holding less of a place in my life and while I continued listening, even that was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the demotivation came from a lack of listeners. There was no sustained support after release apart from a handful of friends which I was eternally grateful for. I wasn&apos;t expecting a swathe of interviews and features but the ego within me had hoped for more. I understand now it&apos;s not just about sending a link and everyone flocks. I don&apos;t think I fully appreciated the support I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; getting, looking for new followers instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m out of that mire now and I&apos;m on 3 albums and a single for this year, with a new full release slated for 2017. The important thing I take away from the experience so far leads me back to the original question: If nobody listened, would I still take music? And the answer is yes. I&apos;ll be honest and say part of me makes music for the validation in my talents. Music was never a career path I set myself from the get go. I&apos;ve had to work to get as good as I am but I need external feedback to know exactly how good that is. But ultimately, I enjoy being in that zone making music; creating something from something else or seemingly nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One test of how well I&apos;ve done with a record is whether I&apos;d listen to this by someone else and the answer has always been yes. There&apos;s a lot of samey music out there, copies of the same aesthetic without pushing any kinds of boundaries. I&apos;ve become a victim of this ideology and I&apos;m definitely not a trendsetter in any way but I reckon my music is unique enough to stand out if it&apos;s heard. And sometimes it isn&apos;t. But that&apos;s okay because I&apos;m listening and I&apos;ll still make music if no one else will.&lt;/p&gt;

But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of this essay; it’s the only one of its kind. Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo’s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act 1: Roger Federer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change – most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many – and he’s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn’t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer’s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn’t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn’t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I’d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It’s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act 2: J Dilla&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn’t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres – hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica – and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, I’d discovered he’d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sampleface.co.uk/28-days-of-dilla-28-j-dilla-donuts/&quot;&gt;Donuts&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act 3: Union and Victory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla’s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer’s and Murray’s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn’t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn’t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles’ Hard Day’s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. “I knew it”, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad’s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reprise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Federer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won’t be leaving the sport completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best “disciples” is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla’s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I’ve been rinsing out for years, the “newer” stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.&lt;/p&gt;

My worst related crime was asking &quot;who Ayn Rand was&quot;. I received mini ridicule and it was a fair cop. But sometimes the question is asked and we&apos;d rather not trudge our way through Google and its index of links to get an answer. Sometimes the question(s) we ask are quite broad and a simple reply would be succinct and quench the knowledge thirst. And there are times when we just want a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are what you might call &quot;technophobes&quot;. My mum panics at the thought of having to retune the television and my dad, despite using Microsoft Office more than me, often asks for help. There was one such occurrence a few days ago when he needed assistance with PowerPoint. I&apos;ve used PowerPoint three times in the past four years so my expertise is somewhat lacking past adding and removing slides. But I always find the answer, or at least try. In this instance, he wanted to do something I had never done before. So what would I do in that situation? Google it. It&apos;s something he could have done, sure, but he&apos;d asked the question and I had no problem helping. And then it hit me. Although the prupose of the call was for help, there was a secondary reason as well - just to talk. Coincidentally, this had fallen on World Mental Health Day and when the realisation hit me, I felt a wave of sadness. I haven&apos;t called my parents nearly enough since I moved out in 2014 and although I&apos;d seen them briefly a couple of weeks ago, this was the first time we&apos;d spoken on the phone for much longer. We&apos;ve not always seen eye to eye over the years but we&apos;ve grown much closer now and he&apos;s been a great mediator whenever I&apos;ve needed help or advice. This was more than a technical support and that&apos;s why &quot;just Google it&quot; isn&apos;t always appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we ask questions, sometimes we&apos;re seeking discourse on the subject. This can enrich all involved with knowledge and interest and, simply, someone to talk to and not feel alone. It&apos;s important not to snub those who are legitimately looking for this. If you feel you can&apos;t have this conversation, direct them to somewhere the information can be found rather than the classic &quot;Google it link&quot;. You never know, by answering the question, you could learn something yourself - I know I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much more to mathematics than those dusty old textbooks from school and the teachers who made lessons as painful as a live autopsies. But not all academics are like this, fortunately. One such professor – Vadim Ponomarenko – has taken the liberty of making &lt;a href=&quot;/jardim/colours/&quot;&gt;colours&lt;/a&gt; out of mathematical constants such as π (pi), you know that symbol you learnt about when you had to work out the area and circumference of a circle. Anyone in the design industry will recognise the conversion part – changing the decimals into hex numbers and producing the colours – and through that, we now have “the colour of pi”. There are also colours for constants such as e (Euler’s number), c (speed of light from E=mc²), φ (phi, more commonly known as the Golden Ratio) and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps you could extend this idea a bit further. For those who studied maths past age 16, you may know about Euler’s identity, an equation using five of the most fundamental constants in mathematics and “cited as an example of deep mathematical beauty”. It’s as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;iπ&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; - 1 = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we look at the result of this equation in hexadecimal, it stays the same and in colouring terms, 0 (or &lt;code&gt;#000000&lt;/code&gt;) is black. Does that therefore make the colour of mathematical beauty black? I’d like to think so but maybe I’m clutching at straws and being crude in my summations. But for a colour that is often in a negative light (pardon the pun), both linguistically and socially, I think this would be remarkable. In fact, black isn’t even a colour – it’s an absence of colour. Mathematical beauty represented as a complete absence of colour and shared with something we often find beautiful when we look up at night – the cosmos. I better leave the hyperbole here.&lt;/p&gt;

This year was my second Record Store Day and I was hoping to pick up some of the exclusives. Unfortunately, the main store I usually go to that was stocking the ones I wanted (Sister Ray) had a queue snaking right round the block so I decided against it (I don’t like being crowded). Instead, I popped into Honest Jon’s where I picked up a Sun Ra record and Miles Davis CD. Then, I went to Soho and Reckless Records, where I picked up a couple more records. My final stop was Music &amp;amp; Video Exchange in Notting Hill. By now, I was in my element. I bought another three Miles Davis CDs (including Bitches Brew, finally!) and a whole load of other bargain gems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a full list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greg Phillinganes – Pulse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rick James - Bustin’ Out of L Seven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ron Carter – New York Slick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makoto Ozone - Makoto Ozone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Rawls – Love All Your Blues Away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather Report – Mysterious Traveller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roy Ayers – You Might Be Surprised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun Ra – Languidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The O’Jays – Ship Ahoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miles Davis – The Birth Of The Cool, Bitches Brew, On The Corner, Miles In The Sky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illa J – Yancey Boys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stoked to get four Miles CDs (alas no vinyl) and a Dilla related purchase. All in all, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my second ever Record Store Day and I’m glad I went in the morning. Maybe next year I’ll be able to pick up some exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;

I got into ambient music a lot more and immersed myself in modern jazz. That made compiling this list a lot trickier than I had anticipated. At first, I was going to do an ordered list but after looking at the god awful monstrosities from the likes of Rolling Stone and Complex, I decided to just give a choice of my favourite 49. No order, just my favourites. At the end of the day, you like what you like and this will be a showcase of my personal preferences. I’ll leave that as a “disclaimer” just in case you question any of the entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, without any further ado, here is the list!&lt;/p&gt;

But this one is slightly different. This is purely based on the albums I’ve listened to this year from 2011, ordered by my favourite right down to my “least” favourite. In that respect, these are MY albums of the year. I won’t like the same albums you will and vice versa so saying “why is X not ahead of Y” is futile. This is a common disclaimer in these kinds of posts and it’s a shame but it needs to be said. So, enough of all that.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also true.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2011 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The title says “This is not a blog” and plays on Rene Magritte&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images&quot;&gt;The Treachery of Images&lt;/a&gt;. It is also true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn’t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, “reality” TV shows. What you see isn’t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren’t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we’re still told it’s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it’s real but it’s not real at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the “development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals”. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one’s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn’t real and that it was just a programme. This isn’t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said “cut”, the “dead” person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn’t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying “unreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world”, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and “interact”. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It’s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I’ve done it in the past, I’m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these “personas” are shed and don’t pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don’t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called “leet speak” in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn’t perceived to be warranted (I’ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique “language” to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Boyle’s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn’t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don’t have to listen to a word I’ve said. These aren’t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation. So that begs the question: is this a blog post or the image of a blog post?&lt;/p&gt;

I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn’t an issue; “I’m okay with rock music, I just don’t love it”. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone’s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I’ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What’s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he’d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn’t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton. There was no real reprieve here other than totally removing myself from the group and the music. The latter came quicker than the former and left me hoping I’d never hear that music again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did a good 4 year run, until this year. Thankfully, no MCR but the rock returned and this time, there was no negative association attached. Why? Because the person that brought it back was my girlfriend. Now, when it comes to music, I can be quite snobbish at times. I tweet about rubbish artists and their lack of talent and regard for decent melodies everyday. But when your girlfriend is involved, you have to really stop and think. And listen. So I had a choice: either continue down the route of disliking anything remotely heavy when it came to rock or accept there was a problem and try and remedy it. The vote was unanimous (well, after a few initial criticisms but she’s so lovely, I couldn’t really continue with them) and I chose to give rock music one last go. I started easy with bands I liked on a basic level: Muse. I already liked Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. I listened to Absolution and quite enjoyed it. As they were one of her favourite bands, that was an easy win. Gave Paramore a go (well one song) and really liked Ignorance. Starting to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger test was the Foo Fighters. Now, I felt the same way about them as I did with Muse, ie. they’re alright. Always knew Dave Grohl was cool, so that helped. On my way to London today, I listened through their latest album, Wasting Light. Knowing there’d be some hard stuff on it, I was a little apprehensive. The contemplation of memories flooding back of college and the emo phase. I played through it anyway… and I wasn’t disappointed. In fact, I was hooked after just 20 seconds. Not one bad track on the whole album (which I will review this week). I don’t have anything to really compare it to (yet), but it really blew me away. I was bobbing my head to the parts that I was worried about. For the first time in my entire life, I was loving a rock album. It was all thanks to my girlfriend, who inadvertently gave me the determination to break the stigma I had attached to the second biggest genre in popular music. I was already hating current pop music (another genre I may have to try and immerse myself in for the same reason) and with rock, I was hating on about 70% of all popular music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not anymore. I probably should have done this years ago. I would have had more people to relate to and share feelings with on how awesome the albums were, but it’s better late than never. Rock needn’t be about people moshing or thrashing about on guitars making nothing but discordant noise – that’s what death and speed metal are for (controversial). I’m pleased to have embraced a genre that I had ignored for many years and I’m looking forward to discovering new bands and albums, not only from rock but its other sub-genres and other genres I’ve been sleeping on. Now, if I can just return the favour and get her to like hip hop…&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Review: Jamiroquai – Rock Dust Light Star</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/jamiroquai-rock-dust-light-star-review/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/jamiroquai-rock-dust-light-star-review/</guid><description>What I really like about this album is that it fills in any gaps made from the other Jamiroquai releases.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;“Here it is, there’s no way to make it better.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai’s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star. Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I’d draw the line there. It’s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who’ve forgotten or just didn’t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai’s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Rock Dust Light Star&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn’t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I’m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you’re a new listener, but won’t blow you away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Couldn’t really think of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 6/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. White Knuckle Ride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funk, it’s house, it’s “high-octane”, it’s Jamiroquai. If it wasn’t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It’s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: “Pressure, it’s not so easy to control”. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Smoke and Mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn’t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It’s a welcome return and it’s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. All Good In The Hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn’t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn’t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&amp;amp;B (separate rant for a separate day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;:  Soul Education from Synkronized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Hurtin’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he’s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it’s their second full foray into a genre they’ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I’ll leave that question up to you, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Blue Skies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What… a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can’t be right. Well it is. And it’s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I’ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren’t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I’ve heard people say “they sing the same stuff over and over” to which I’d reply “yeah, because they’re a funk band. You don’t say that about James Brown, do you?”. I haven’t said that yet, but I will one day. It’s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it’d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it’s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn’t. It’s a shame because it’s definitely a radio favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Lifeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It’s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we’d break up. That never happened). It’s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. She’s a Fast Persuader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This. Song. Rocks. My. Socks. Into. Space. I’m getting goosebumps just from writing about it. I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I’m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing, an instrumental that didn’t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass… eargasmic. It’s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 10/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Two Completely Different Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Kay says it’s from Synkronized, Matt Johnson says it’s from Dynamite. It has elements of both albums but I’d probably side with Matt on this one. It’s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it’d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Goodbye To My Dancer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another title that had me laughing and scratching my head (this time I actually acted on my thoughts, but still didn’t laugh out loud) but I needn’t. For me, it’s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!). It has a African/Latin kind of feel, which could be an overflow from the previous track and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Can’t think, feel free to help me out here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11. Never Gonna Be Another&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one almost copies the chords from the previous tracks and adds to the melancholy. It’s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it’s a good break up song if you’re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you’re not 14 anymore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similar song&lt;/strong&gt;: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 6.5/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12. Hey Floyd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is how you finish an album. Grand, majestic and multi-layered. It’d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who’s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn’t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn’t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he’s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it’s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I’m digressing from the main point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It’s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it’s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They’re behaving more like an indie band, which I don’t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn’t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It’s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it’s going to be a white knuckle ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;
