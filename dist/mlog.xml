&lt;p&gt;Here is my mlog for September 2025 (so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve watched a lot of Hallmark movies. It&apos;s all I can handle at the moment and they&apos;re easy to find and watch on YouTube. None of them have been particularly good but you don&apos;t watch them for the stellar acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2025/09/&quot;&gt;my Letterboxd diary on their main site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/letterboxd-diaries/&quot;&gt;my historical diaries on my site&lt;/a&gt; but here&apos;s a quick list (in reverse order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling for You&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One Summer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman J. Israel, Esq.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Taste of Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip That Romance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trespass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the Moon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Oneiric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baking Up Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Roman J. Israel, Esq. had been better. Denzel was great but it just felt like a sloppy movie with an annoying ending. Trespass was a movie I&apos;d seen one scene of decades ago and I found it again after looking up what I remember on Google and searching the script for certain words. Classic me. Sadly that movie wasn&apos;t great either. Maybe I should watch good movies next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Fantasy IX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been playing this for the past couple of months and it&apos;s my favourite FF to date. However, I&apos;m nearing the end and I&apos;m ready for it to be done and move onto other games, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breath of Fire IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still haven&apos;t finished it. I want to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Plucky Squire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought this last night (20th Sep). It&apos;s been on my radar since the first trailer and I&apos;m excited to try it this weekend. I&apos;ll report back whether it&apos;s good or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watchword&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought another word game called Word Play which I&apos;ve enjoyed playing with my son and Watchword has some similar themes but it seems very different. Could this be the gateway to a roguelike fandom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another game that&apos;s been on my Steam wishlist for a while. It&apos;s queer, it&apos;s colourful, and it has puzzles. I can&apos;t wait to start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Candy videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m currently obsessed with seeing people making peanut brittle. I don&apos;t eat it but hearing the mixture his the metal table and getting spread across the surface? So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suits clips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the lawyer show? Well, I loved it when it was on air and so did my mum. And now I&apos;ve been watching clips and sending them to her to enjoy. I&apos;ve also started it again from the beginning and it&apos;s so funny seeing everyone with their Season 1 hair and body weight. Zero eye bags though. They had to draw the line somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hyprland rice demos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” I hear you ask. Hyprland is a “tiling Wayland compositor” (in layperson&apos;s terms, it manages how windows tile on the screen and it looks super fancy). Rices are like on-screen desktop setup and from the videos I&apos;ve seen, they all look so cool. I managed to get Arch Linux + Hyprland on my &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/gamesir-g8-galileo-peladn-wi-6-mini-pc&quot;&gt;mini PC&lt;/a&gt; and it&apos;s been good so far. Just need to figure out the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dexter YouTube Poops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve become obsessed with YouTube Poops of the show Dexter, specifically the scene where Doakes finds Dexter in a shipping yard where he&apos;s looking for Deb “in a cargo box”. It&apos;s Steamed Hams but with swearing and a surprise, motherf*cker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;YouTube Poops in general&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@DaThings&quot;&gt;DaThings&lt;/a&gt; is a genius, that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autumn is Palmer season as far as I&apos;m concerned and I&apos;m locked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ahwlee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When am I not listening to Ahwlee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The radio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to Smooth daily. Same songs over and over but my brain is smooth and numb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a bit of Black Meme and jailbroke my Kindle. That counts as reading, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched 3 movies last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean and Sober&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Angry Birds Movie 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d been meaning to watch Clean and Sober for a while, just for my man Michael Keaton and it was really good. It was quite tense in its depictions of addiction and denial before realisation kicks in at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angry Birds Movie 2 was better than I thought. Obviously it was an Angry Birds film so not awe-inspiring in any way (and arguably way past its peak) but it was funny in places and serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with my son over 3 nights (because he fell asleep each time). It was the Johnny Depp pretends to be Michael Jackson version and again, good and funny if not a bit uncomfortable in places but that&apos;s Tim Burton for ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shin Pokémon Blue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m kinda tired of the &quot;we made Gen 1 better because, in hindsight, it SUCKED but we&apos;re gonna pretend like we knew it sucked back in 1998&quot; Pokémon ROM hacks so I decided to go for an enhancement ROM hack that keeps most of the game intact but adds improvements in places and subtle storyline changes that don&apos;t completely change the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&apos;m enjoying it and I thought I&apos;d try a Nuzlocke. I&apos;ll add my final team on &lt;a href=&quot;https://centiskor.ch/&quot;&gt;centiskor.ch&lt;/a&gt; if I beat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Super Kirby Clash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a little bit of Super Kirby Clash with my son which was fun. It&apos;s one of my favourite free-to-play games with non-intrusive microtransactions that you don&apos;t need to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gronya&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another shout out to Gronya, who I started watching a few months ago. She released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyt69EZgjww&quot;&gt;a new video about Dragon Quest Heroes II&lt;/a&gt; you should check out if that&apos;s your kinda thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;House clips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve watched so many clips of House that I should really start watching the whole series. But I&apos;m gonna hold off until I finish...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mentalist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started The Mentalist as a way to get through packing before I moved on 31st October. I managed to get through 3 seasons before I moved and it&apos;s been fun rewatching it. I&apos;d forgotten some of the episodes and, for me, they didn&apos;t age super well but I&apos;m about halfway through and looking forward to getting closer to Red John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I got into Robert Palmer in a big way and I thought I&apos;d listen to him again to mark that &quot;anniversary&quot; so to speak. It was comforting and I&apos;d like to do that some more in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched 4 movies last month and all but one was with my son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2024/08/&quot;&gt;my Letterboxd diary on their main site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/letterboxd-diaries/&quot;&gt;my historical diaries on my site&lt;/a&gt; but here&apos;s a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despicable Me 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alien: Romulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kung Fu Panda 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two Kung Fu Panda movies were my son&apos;s idea after we watched the third one in July. We watched them in reverse order but it didn&apos;t matter as they were pretty standard hero-in-peril-saves-the-world movies. Nice animation, nice action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien: Romulus was... not great. As I said on Letterboxd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This film felt underbaked. Also not a fan of the Black &quot;guy&quot; getting abused so often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think about how well The Thing portrayed distrust and cabin fever and I&apos;m watching this movie and those themes were treated like difficult problems to solve and this is the best they could come up with. Didn&apos;t feel particularly original and it generally pissed me off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the words of Peppermint, &amp;lt;q&amp;gt;have I seen it? Girl, I want to &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;un&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;see it.&amp;lt;/q&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the plus side, it made me appreciate Prometheus and Covenant more (which isn&apos;t saying much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally Despicable Me 4 was really good; better than I expected and it finished with Everybody Wants To Rule The World by Tears for Fears (which we both sung along to 🥹)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breath of Fire IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been playing this for the last few weeks and I&apos;ve really enjoyed so far. I love the isometric view and the pixel art graphics, which make it feel more like a GBA game than a PS1 game but that doesn&apos;t diminish its quality. I&apos;m following along with a speedrun video and according to that, I&apos;m about halfway through the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragon Quest XI S&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still playing, still enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gronya&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta give a shout out to Gronya, a Dragon Quest content creator I&apos;ve been watching for a while but recently I started watching her streams and joined her Discord. The community is awesome and they&apos;ve come at an awesome time as I was flagging for the last couple of weeks, mental health wise, and they all came in clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrestling clips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been reliving the Attitude Era and some of the later WCW eras before they got bought by WWE. Defining parts of my childhood, even if none of it has aged well. Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjWPoQWdmjg&quot;&gt;Stone Cold&apos;s King of the Ring promo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulpEhmdNhYc&quot;&gt;Scott Steiner shooting on Ric Flair&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlJFKLxZxZI&quot;&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ahwlee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still listening to Ahwlee, for vibes and inspo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoochy is my favourite album. So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Late 80s/early 90s smooth jazz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t care, I love smooth jazz (not you, Kenny G).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a teensy bit of You Are Here so yay me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched 9 movies last month as a distraction from my generally crap mood for March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2024/03/&quot;&gt;my Letterboxd diary on their main site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/letterboxd-diaries/&quot;&gt;my historical diaries on my site&lt;/a&gt; but here&apos;s a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlotte&apos;s Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy Death Day 2U&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nemesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte&apos;s Web was a father-son thing and it was cute and sweet and he enjoyed it. Julia Roberts&apos;s voice was so relaxing as Charlotte and Steve Buscemi played a great rat as Templeton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I revisited the Happy Death Day series for the first time in a while and had a bit of a 90s film bonanza for the rest of the month, starting with Street Fighter (RIP &amp;lt;span lang=&quot;es-PR&quot;&amp;gt;Raúl Juliá&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;), doing the original Mortal Kombat double for the first time, revisiting Nemesis and Heat, and finally ending with My Life, a poignant movie about life and how we can craft it through a series of misunderstandings but change them at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragon Quest VIII&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try a DQ game that didn&apos;t tie me to the PS4 but also wasn&apos;t one of the 16-bit games, and since VIII is so highly regarded, I went for that. I initially tried this on PS2 but the frame rate was so bad on the emulator (even on a Pixel 5), that I went for the 3DS version and it&apos;s been great with the voice acting and the mechanics. Again, I don&apos;t mind the grind as much especially with speed up and it&apos;s not like Pokémon where you don&apos;t necessarily need strategy (compared to VGC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragon Quest XI S&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing how good this looked on PS4, I decided to get a PS4 Pro just so I could play it. Yes, it was already on Switch but I don&apos;t regret the decision but it looks and plays amazingly and it&apos;s a game I&apos;m co-oping with my son which adds a unique element to it all. The voice acting is stellar, I actually enjoy the cut scenes for once, and it&apos;s just a gorgeous game so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked this up as a promotion treat and I&apos;ve loved it so far. It has all the charm of the previous DQM games and the mechanics are so easy to get lost in. I love being able to speed through battles as grinding is a pain in any RPG. I know there are supposed to be frame rate issues later on but I&apos;ve not reached that part yet and, having played Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for a year and a half, I&apos;ll cope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragon Quest Builders 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a game my son and I could play together but he didn&apos;t like all the talking so I&apos;ve played a bit on my own. Not as much as the others but it&apos;s been enjoyable. Minecraft meets Dragon Quest, what&apos;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;yr fave film critic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Dom has a podcast series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G&quot;&gt;yr fave film critic&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about film news, what he&apos;s watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It&apos;s so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order clips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said &quot;here, have some more&quot; and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn&apos;t conducive to good mental health. But the clips were good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ahwlee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been listening to a lot of his music, for inspiration and just for the vibes. He&apos;s one of my favourite producers right now and his album VII is exemplary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&apos;re my most listened to group on Last.fm and they actually dropped some new music in April which I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No books again this month. Still bad, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched 10 movies this week, heavily inspired by my favourite film critic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TheArmchairAuteur&quot;&gt;Dom Griffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2023/11/&quot;&gt;my Letterboxd diary on their main site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/letterboxd-diaries/&quot;&gt;my historical diaries on my site&lt;/a&gt; but here&apos;s a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Verdict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guilty as Sin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thick as Thieves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nemesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swordfish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face/Off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postmortem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animalympics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of them, Nemesis was my favourite (a recommendation by Dom). It was directed by Albert Pyun and stars a cyborg trying to free himself from the life as a cop and the police demanding he do one last job. It&apos;s chaotic, a mess, and absolutely fantastic. At first, I was like &quot;okay, this isn&apos;t too bad&quot; and then there were two scenes that elevated my enjoyment. One involved an old woman getting harassed by a robot, only for her to pull out a gun from her bag and shooting it to death. Damn, granny! Then there was a fight scene with the main character sliding down a muddy chute and fending off a robot and it was incredible. I&apos;m very tempted to watch it all again. The plot itself is lacking and the dialogue is objectively awful but that all adds to the film&apos;s charm and I don&apos;t think Pyun was trying to make an Oscar winner here. Instead, he won my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, my least favourite was another Pyun movie called Postmortem. It started Charlie Sheen in the lead role and it just felt like a feature length episode of Taggart (IYKYK), both for the subject matter and the fact it was set in Glasgow (it was originally meant to be set in San Francisco; talk about a switch up!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also watched Animalympics for the first time in about 25 years and that was really cool and funny. I still knew the words to the songs (thanks, brain!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon Platinum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my playthrough a few months ago and I finally finished it. I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as I wanted. It cemented my opinion that the original Sinnoh games were vastly overrated and I wish Gen 8 hadn&apos;t been dominated by them so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon White&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing Platinum, I had the choice of BW or XY. In the end, I chose White despite having completed Black and Black 2 already this year but I needed to give the generation one last chance to see if the first games were really that bad. The difference here is that I&apos;m playing White on an emulator and the graphics are so much better. I might actually enjoy the game this time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;yr fave film critic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Dom has a podcast series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G&quot;&gt;yr fave film critic&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about film news, what he&apos;s watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It&apos;s so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order clips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said &quot;here, have some more&quot; and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn&apos;t conducive to good mental health. But the clips were good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere near as much as the weeks before but I still listened to Addicted to Love, I Didn&apos;t Mean To Turn You On, and You Are In My System amongst others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Corinne Bailey Rae&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another amazing artist from West Yorkshire, Corinne Bailey Rae&apos;s new album Black Rainbows is amazing. It has some rock, some punk, R&amp;amp;B, electronica, classical, all of it. And her voice sounds sublime. Amazing range, you should definitely check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other music you should check out&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eddie Chacon - Sundown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantic - Dancing While Falling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halibab Matador - Souvenirs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thxk_u - B.O.B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earfluvv &amp;amp; aroma - Sonic Oddities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No books again this week. Still bad, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No movies this week. I tried to &quot;acquire&quot; Training Day but my &quot;means of acquisition&quot; were thwarted by slow &quot;acquitision speeds&quot; (please read between the lines here). It&apos;s on my list though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon Crystal Legacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally completed it and I&apos;ll be doing a writeup on my Pokémon fan site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://centiskor.ch/&quot;&gt;centiskor.ch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Virtua Tennis 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still playing this on and off but it&apos;s started to freeze a lot which messes up my Career mode progress. I suppose this device wasn&apos;t really made for Dreamcast so I&apos;ll take what I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Octopath Traveler 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally started it and I&apos;m enjoying it so far. The cut scenes are a bit arduous but the battle system is really cool and I&apos;ve missed buying equipment for characters. The Golden Sun inspiration is clear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been about 18 years since I last played this and I&apos;ve not got far yet but it&apos;s been fun to see one of my favourite GBA games in all its isometric glory. Also, the dialogue goes hard! No cutesy stuff here and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still going through my Robert Palmer hyperfixation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Astro tutorials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is built with Astro but I&apos;d like to improve my knowledge with JS in particular. Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@CodinginPublic&quot;&gt;Coding in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rival Locke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m onto the second season of Rival Locke where they play Gold/Silver. Lots more noises and silliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no signs of stopping. Nearly at 200 scrobbles in the last month. He&apos;s was just so good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elaquent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoyed his latest album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjov9qcWvs&quot;&gt;Rediscovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No books read this week. Bad, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mlog #001: Halloween 2023</title><link>https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/mlog/mlog-31-10-2023/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/mlog/mlog-31-10-2023/</guid><description>My mlog for Halloween 2023</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic. No notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less of a classic but I love Lugia and the legendary Kanto birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coyote Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed it for what it was and it&apos;s one of my girlfriend&apos;s favourite movies so we watched it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deep Blue Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really fun action movie from the 90s and it&apos;s another of my girlfriend&apos;s favourite movies so we watched it together for her birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pokémon Crystal Legacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying this ROM hack. Crystal is arguably the best Gen 2 game so to get an enhanced version makes it even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Virtua Tennis 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a RGB30, I can play Dreamcast games easier and that means playing my favourite tennis game of all time (sorry, Mario Tennis). So fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tetris 64&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a Tetris fix and while this version isn&apos;t the best, it did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Octopath Traveler 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&apos;t started it yet but I bought it while on offer and I&apos;m excited, although I do have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9wrpey/anxiety_about_starting_a_new_game/&quot;&gt;new game anxiety&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m currently going through a Robert Palmer obsessive phase. He was so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;George Michael videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m also going through another George Michael obsessive phase (I&apos;ve had a few since the late 90s). Again, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rival Locke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed something to listen and laugh to. If you don&apos;t know what a Rival Locke is, you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzDHex22XQypi_vE9biMsYXx4eENtINe&quot;&gt;watch the one I watched&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People making burgers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love burgers and I love seeing people make smash burgers. I hope I can get one of those iron press thingies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mlog/mlog-31-10-2023/#robert-palmer-videos&quot;&gt;See above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ahwlee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always on heavy rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wun Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
