I effectively run them all on my own and the topics I cover are the opposite of niche:\n\nMusic (but mostly sampling) - Sampleface\nCulture - Cultrface\nSTEM (science, tech, engineering, and maths) - LOGiCFACE\nSports - Playrface\nGaming - Distant Arcade\n\nThere are plenty of sites who cover them individually and collectively. You\u2019ll probably know them well and you\u2019ll also know they have teams of hundreds, if not thousands of writers.\nAnd here I am on my own, trying to compete with them on Google. At first, I wrote whatever I wanted. Then I got serious but lost motivation to write. Then I got my mojo back to write whatever and now I\u2019m back with wanting to write about specific things with SEO (search engine optimisation) in mind.\nMy mind and goals keep flitting between the two and I\u2019m constantly trying to find a medium all the while knowing I\u2019m on my own. I don\u2019t ask for help because I can\u2019t afford to pay anyone and I don\u2019t feel comfortable asking people to write for free, especially now. So I update when I can, wondering how much better they could all be if things were different.\nI guess I should write something then.\nTagged as:\nblogging Sampleface Cultrface LOG!CFACE Playrface Distant Arcade \n\nThis is my content creation flow What's the obsession with folding phone?\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBOOM!

It was a watershed moment for a lot of people when it could have been avoided. I\u2019m still tired, still angry, still suspicious, and still reeling from the last year. I allowed myself to think changes could be made but white people let me down. Again. And while Black communities have responded and shifted and fought hard in that time which has helped me and many other, nothing has really changed besides some names on food packaging. I\u2019ve seen so-called allies get his name wrong on videos, buy books to \u201cdo the reading\u201d, give them away without starting them, make snide comments about \u201cnot being woke enough\u201d, complain of \u201dally fatigue\u201c, post black squares only to take them down because they messed up the grid, people remain silent despite their presence and influence within Black cultures. It\u2019s been a lot.\nIt makes it look like George Floyd died so Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima could retire from their advertising duties and got a \u201cthanks, bro\u201d from Nancy Pelosi.

        "pub_date": "14 Apr 2018",
        "body": "\n\n14 Apr 2018\n4 Creative Article Ideas - Inspired By \"The Read\"\n\nI was about 5 years late to the game but I finally got into The Read a few months ago and catapulted itself to the top of my All-Time Fave Podcasts list. The dynamic duo of Kid Fury and Crissle give me unadulterated life and joy. But other than their wit and advice, their presentation is an underrated element of the show. Episodes are broken up into sections much like any other podcast.\nTaken from Wikipedia:\n\nBlack Excellence where Kid Fury picks someone in the Black community to celebrate. One that has accomplished something that is worthy of high recognition.\nHot Tops, previously Sick Sad World, also selected by Kid Fury (the segment has undergone several other name changes, including Hot Topics, Shade In Full, and the fan favorite, \u201cBitch, You Guessed It!!\u201c)\nListener Letters as curated by Crissle (the segment is changed to Listener Questions when done during a live show)\nThe Read where Kid Fury and Crissle \u201cread\u201d (African American gay slang for giving one\u2019s harsh opinion) a person or topic.\n\nThese four sections cover a period of around 2 hours. You don\u2019t even notice the time disappearing such is their ability to captivate. But what does this have to do with blogging? Well, the format can translate into your blog posts if you\u2019re running out of ideas. The debate over word counts, long vs short form, impacts on SEO and so on will continue forever but what you write needs to fulfill a purpose for the reader. A 1000 word essay doesn\u2019t automatically win over a 200 word piece because it has more content. Trying new ways of presentation can open new doors to new readers and potentially gain a fanbase.\nLet\u2019s look at those four sections:\nBlack Excellence \u2192 Celebration of achievements in your sector\nWherever you work, you\u2019ll be part of a wider community. It can help both you and the community to share the love and appreciation. From a personal perspective, I have Google Alerts set up with specific keyword terms and share stories relevant to my blogs. I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific \u201cexcellence\u201d series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you\u2019ve mentioned them.\nHot Tops \u2192 Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector\nThis is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads must know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.\nListener Letters \u2192 Q&A\nThis might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an \u201cagony aunt\u201d column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.\nThe Read \u2192 Opinion pieces, rants, critiques\nOp-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I\u2019ve had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn\u2019t write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is paramount here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I\u2019ve written pieces on cultural appropriation and it\u2019s important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn\u2019t be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier. Linking the two together will add more link juice which is a SEO\u2019s dream.\nDo you have any other format suggestions? Comments aren\u2019t working so if you do, email me and I\u2019ll add them to this article.

I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they\u2019re worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.\n1. RKZ\nThere\u2019s an element of bias in this selection but I don\u2019t really care. RKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I\u2019m not Grade A broke!)\nWebsite | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | Soundcloud\n2. Arkotype\nI\u2019m simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the \u201cpassion project\u201d of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pok\u00e9mon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.\nWebsite | Twitter\n3. Alex Stewart\nI went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart\u2019s Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books Moneyball, Soccernomics and The Numbers Game. I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that\u2019s how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.\nTwitter | Facebook\n4. Liam Wong\nI love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his \u2018Tokyo Nights\u2019 (TO:KY:OO) project. Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you\u2019re looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.\nWebsite | Instagram | Twitter\n5. Jer\u2019Maine\nI have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It\u2019s no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer\u2019Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of DatCode, a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.\n#DatCode\n6. Nguyen Le\nRoger Federer fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I\u2019ve been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn\u2019t poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.\nWebsite | Dribbble\n7. KUMA GOLD\nI can\u2019t speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that\u2019s where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I\u2019ve seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can\u2019t wait.\nWebsite | Spotify\n8. The Music Snobs\nIt\u2019s been a while since their last episode but nobody does music critique better than The Music Snobs. I feel honoured to be in contact with the team - Arthur, Isaac, Snoop and Jehan - and welcome every opportunity for a conversation about our favourite artists. Their opinions don\u2019t always align with mine but I have a great respect for them and their articulation is second to none. Forget all those publications telling you what you should think about music and just listen to these guys and who they recommend for the craft.\nTwitter\nTagged as:\ncreativity Roger Federer \n\n2017 Needs Brevity And Nuance My Idea Debt\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBeyond tired: Part 21 vs 10,000Morsel #7: Random Pok\u00e9mon Team GeneratorBanana rum cake recipe\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "1 Jan 2017",
        "body": "\n\n1 Jan 2017\n2017 Needs Brevity And Nuance\n\nFirstly, happy new year to you all!\nThis post has been on my mind for a while and seeing as it\u2019s the start of a new year, I thought it necessary to write it now while I\u2019m in a writing mood. There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I\u2019ve noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic \u201cI was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?\u201d retort. Well, what did you expect?\nOf the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and claiming \u201cif you don\u2019t say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid.\u201d (That\u2019s a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago. It was as follows:\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen [\u2026] She turned out to be witty and bright as well.\u201d\n\nIt was later deleted after accusations of sexism. No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn\u2019t read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That\u2019s not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here\u2019s a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don\u2019t do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can\u2019t retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It\u2019s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there\u2019s another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there\u2019s no chance of an alternative perspective - it\u2019s just bad.\nAnd that\u2019s precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I\u2019ve overused that word and it\u2019s lost all meaning but it\u2019s a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it\u2019s very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it\u2019s not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who\u2019s getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.\nBut where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I\u2019ve edited and published it. I think brevity is important for 2017 because online media in particular has suffered with linguistic saturation and an obsession with narrative. I recently wrote an unpublished article called Football Is Dead where I rang the death knell on the sport thanks to its replacement: The Narrative. There\u2019s a lot of focus on talking and writing over the actual event and it isn\u2019t confined to the annals of sport. The news is overflowing with jargon, unnecessary words and ill-thought ideas. I\u2019ve had to block The Guardian on Twitter because the opinion pieces coming through were terrible. I couldn\u2019t believe they got past an editor, both in context and general grammar and construction. My best writing has come from an academic perspective, where both brevity and nuance are crucial tools. I wouldn\u2019t have got a First for my dissertation without them. We need those tools for what we read and hear in 2017.\nThis won\u2019t dumb down journalistic output as some may suggest. Active writing can still flourish with care for succinctness and understanding of social differences. In fact, these ideas will bolster the messages needed. A clearly constructed message along with the follow through of action and education are vital in this fight against rising fascism. Trump and his ilk don\u2019t know the meaning of brevity and nuance. Publications like Inf0wars and Br3itbart are overflowing with offensive and confused rhetoric and because we\u2019re in a culture of more is better and they shout it the loudest, it\u2019s taken in by so many. That\u2019s not to say the direct opposite is what we need - talking quiet and saying nothing never solved anything. It\u2019s about saying and doing the considered amount with respect for the marginalised, particularly when their voice needs to be heard and not censored or quashed.\nTagged as:\nlife \n\nIf Nobody Listened, Would I Still Make Music?

There are some things I\u2019m very passionate about and convey as much authority I have without pretending that I have more. Sometimes, people miscontrue that as a higher level of expertise but I can\u2019t control their opinions. But I mostly shitpost and talk about my thoughts out loud. I ask questions; the kind that people should be asking but don\u2019t. And I think critical thinking is crucial now, more than ever. We have the power and often pretend like the power has already been lost (and people LOVE to tell you *insert doomsday prediction* is already here!\u201d and offer no further context about what any of that means).\nI\u2019ll write a thread of consciousness or I\u2019ll write a single, throwaway comment.

Well, I\u2019m here to provide yet another and I reckon mine is pretty good (but probably not original).\nPer the Simpsons meme above where Homer originally likened marriage to an orange, I think AI has a similar analogy. An orange is made up of its skin and the juicy segments in the middle and without the skin, there\u2019s nothing holding those segments together. I would say the orange, as a whole thing, is AI and the segments within are the various techniques and sub-disciplines that make it up. The skin is the front-facing side that we all see and hear about in the media (and, like AI, I\u2019m sure certain people would argue which orange is the best, which tastes bad, and why oranges are good or bad for you).\nHere are some examples of AI subtopics:\n\nMachine learning (arguably the most important and often used interchangeably with \u201cAI\u201d which I would personally disagree with)\n\nDeep learning\nReinforcement learning\nQ-learning\nSupervised learning\nUnsupervised learning\n\n\nNatural language processing\n\nTopic modelling\nSentiment analysis\nEntity extraction\nClassification\nSummarisation\nFuzzy matching\n\n\nNeural networks\nComputer vision\nRobotics\nSpeech processing\n\nFeel free to let me know if any of those need rearranging but they all make up what AI is.\nAs for computer science, those would be\u2026 orange tree grove I guess?

        "body": "\n\n17 Jul 2023\nAI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started\n\nI was talking to a friend on Twitter about how large language models (LLMs) have helped me get work done in a roundabout way:\n\nFrom a writing perspective, I\u2019ve not known where to start sometimes so I\u2019ve prompted a LLM to write what I needed. Naturally, it was crap so I then just rewrote it completely. I got the job done. Had I started from 0, I may have struggled for longer.\n\nAnd then, by chance, I found an article about a cool web app that lets you create 19th century ornamental tile illustrations. The last paragraph was the part that struck a timely chord (with the key phrase in bold):\n\nMany of the initial drafts of this tool were at least partially generated by ChatGPT 4. They never came close to anything you could simply use, but they were instrumental in showing me what\u2019s possible. More importantly, they greatly lowered the inertia I would have to overcome to start building something like this in the first place. We live in interesting times.\n\nI love that idea; AI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started. It seems counterproductive to prompt a LLM to write something, only to completely rewrite it and yet it\u2019s more effective than starting at a blank screen. And I think that comes down to not knowing how or where to start, seeing something that just isn\u2019t right and improving on it.\nIt\u2019s a Ship of Theseus for the digital age (I know Wandavision referenced it but I\u2019ve been referencing it for years so suck it.)\nTagged as:\nAI tech \n\nSome caveats to SEO and web performance The SEO of Pok\u00e9mon nicknames\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nWe are not data points.

        "body": "\n\n14 May 2023\nAI should be a last resort\n\nOoh, edgy title! But let me back up my lukewarm take (heh).\nWe\u2019re told that AI is simultaneously the present and the future and you\u2019ll be a husk of a human being if you don\u2019t just embrace it and get on the train. Of course, this is absolute nonsense fueled by hypercapitalism but that doesn\u2019t make it any less convincing to \u201cexperts\u201d and companies looking for more profit and less outlay (see: tech layoffs).\nThe problem with this ideology is the implication that whatever you\u2019re doing now is outdated because we said so and regardless of whether it works. Writers aren\u2019t any less qualified or effective than they were in 2019 or before. So why is this burgeoning technology suddenly an answer to a problem that never really existed? Except there is a problem: companies need to recoup the money they lost during the pandemic, and what better way to do that than to not pay employees who need pay rises and instead completely replace them with language models they can tinker with at the fraction of the price. If those writers are lucky, they might stay on but have an increased workload (for no extra pay) involving editing LLM outputs rather than writing copy from scratch.\nThat\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in and will continue to be in while AI is seen as the first port of call to any kind of problem. By taking a step back, you can see the wider picture and realise that there are a multitude of options that come before opting for AI. Here are just a few:\n\nAsk yourself truthfully if there\u2019s even a problem to solve\nPay your damn people and let them work if there is\nConsider a programmatic approach where applicable (this comes with similar caveats to AI use so don\u2019t fall down a similar trap)\n\nI object/subject!\nOf course, none of this is to say \u201cdon\u2019t even THINK about AI\u201d\u2014I\u2019m not a conservative\u2014but instead think before you leap into something that could cause harm, and arguably is already. Testing stuff is cool and recommended. That\u2019s why I built Oapy with a mirror of OpenAI\u2019s Playground tool. Give this prompt engineering thing a go, read up on how it really works, and see what sticks and what doesn\u2019t. A great article I read a few weeks ago by Mitchell Hashimoto called Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting\n touches on the objective and subjective nature of prompt design and where our LLM use cases fall. I\u2019d found issues with using LLMs for generative purposes despite using all the techniques I\u2019d found from language tech professionals. But Mitchell suggests that these use cases fall in the subjective category and that makes them hard to test for accuracy:\n\nIf we have an input that can produce an objectively correct (or I\u2019d even argue \u201cmostly correct\u201d) output, then prompt engineering can be successfully applied. Examples of problems with objectively correct results: information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation, etc.\n\nHowever, if we have an input that produces something subjectively correct, then prompt engineering is much less useful. The best example of subjective results are creative tasks such as art generation, writing, semantic search.\n\nOf course, people will\u2014and should\u2014argue that prompt engineering has helped improve creative tasks. But that also, arguably, requires the practioner to have a good understanding of their niche. A very good artist or writer with enough knowledge of what they want and how to achieve it via prompt engineering will get the results they need. It won\u2019t need testing either as they\u2019ll just know based on experience. But someone looking to cut costs and maximise profit will assume you say some magic words and press a button and it\u2019ll just happen because the AI bros said so and they\u2019re never wrong.\nCases where AI could be better\nMy main argument for AI as a last resort is stronger for those subjective channels of generation. However, with the objective channels such as \u201cinformation extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation etc.\u201d (ie. most NLP problems) AI can go further up the pecking order. That\u2019s because tools for these tasks have existed for years and have shown varying levels of success. If they work for you, perhaps you don\u2019t need to consider AI at all. But if you need improvements or can\u2019t afford to pay for these tools (a better cost-cutting measure than firing writers I\u2019d say), AI would be a good consideration. That\u2019s because language models in particular are very good at solving NLP problems, with minimal training or supervision. For example, my RALTS classification tool uses DistilBart-MNLI with zero-shot learning and the results have been good enough that I\u2019d never want to fine-tune it. Here\u2019s how it classified this blog post:\n\nAnother great article I found a while back titled \u201cChoosing the right language model for your NLP use case\u201d showed the efficacy of various models (as of September 2022). Some were very good at the aforementioned objective NLP tasks and not so good with content generation, and vice versa. We obviously have ChatGPT and GPT-4 now, as well as a growing number of open source models built of those commercial models, and those gaps are getting smaller by the day. But there isn\u2019t truly a one-size-fits-all model yet and, despite what anyone is telling you, we are no closer to AGI and I don\u2019t think we ever will be so stop talking about it, okay?!\nBeing conscious with my conscience\nI\u2019ve been the main guy at work when it comes to AI. I talk about it a lot, I try to show the best use cases, I\u2019ve even done a webinar on it. But I also show the potential risks and harms of the tech as well because it\u2019s not all interesting and amazing. I worry that the former will outweigh the latter in people\u2019s perceptions and I\u2019ll be the one responsible. That could be unfounded but who am I to say?\nI also worry I come off as a hypocrite. I do believe there should be some kind of pause and some kind of regulation but I don\u2019t agree with the open letter that likes of Gary Marcus and Elon Musk signed because Musk was involved, which despite Marcus\u2019s claims should be scrutinised given his practices and intentions; this isn\u2019t a The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point moment). I also worry that a regulatory committee will be whitewashed and cause further harm to the women in AI who have been advocating for better ethics for years.\nI don\u2019t have any concrete answers to the problems I see in AI but I do know that I want people to be safe. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re getting any safer with this tech in its current state and with what we\u2019re told it can, should, is, and will be used for. AI should be the last resort, not the protection of our lives and where we live.\nTagged as:\nAI tech \n\nProbably Autistic Post-It Note directories\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nVideos I've been watching to keep me goingThings that aren&#39;t in the U.S. ConstitutionWhat's the obsession with folding phone?If I were a rich man #1\n\n\n\n\n",

Sort of.\nI took a couple of weeks off from my main Twitter account as it was getting too much and I knew the holiday period would be difficult for my mental health (spoiler alert: it was).\nI\u2019m kinda back but I\u2019m not tweeting as much because I\u2019m still uncomfortable about it. All the talk about the COVID-19 pandemic, the meta-discourse about the pandemic, and marketing industry chat is a lot to jump back into. I also don\u2019t give a crap about marketing right now. I will still do work to the best of my ability and I still enjoy the technicalities of what SEO is/should be about but the constant talk about tips and ideas\u2014regurgitated from the same places offering little to no tangible solutions or actions for people to work with\u2014drain me. My peers do it or share it and I just find it dull and annoying. Not sorry.\nTo be honest, most of the overall online chat I\u2019m seeing is grating on me and I can\u2019t spend too long \u201clogged on\u201d. And to that end, I\u2019m beyond tired again and while I\u2019ve told people I\u2019m okay (because I am physically and logistically), mentally I\u2019m not and I haven\u2019t been since March last year when this all kicked off. I know I need therapy but not CBT this time and I\u2019ll try to seek that this year. I\u2019ve lost things dear to me and I have a lot of unresolved issues to overcome and reconcile with. I also have a son to look after amongst all this shit.\nSo if you\u2019re reading this and got this far, you don\u2019t have to tell me you\u2019re \u201cthere for me\u201d or anything. I don\u2019t know who or when to talk to anyone just yet (unless you\u2019re a Black therapist, in which case let\u2019s talk!) and ultimately, I want to be left alone to feel better and hope I can someday leave the house and maybe even my city for something other than a COVID test or an alternative Christmas.\nTagged as:\nCOVID-19 life \n\nMy Favourite Albums of 2020 Sound familiar?\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nFuture Coca-Cola slogans with GPT-3.5I tried Vicuna and it made me laughA note on some notes on writingMy Review of 2017\n\n\n\n\n",

We\u2019re still living through a pandemic. We watched the protests last year. Our parents went through worse, as did their parents, ad infinitum.

We need you to use your privilege. Normally, I\u2019d write this on Twitter but I\u2019m sick to death of saying these things and people proverbially seal clapping. What good are likes, RTs and replies of agreement right now? Josh Rivers, founder of Busy Being Black, made a good suggestion on Instagram tonight: if you\u2019re using social media to say you\u2019re shocked, you have the power to block and report racist abuse you see, contacting people in power and telling them it\u2019s happening and you want it to stop. Do something. Anything. What the hell kind of reading were you allegedly doing last year that you can\u2019t do anything but tap some buttons on your phone and just go about your day as if it doesn\u2019t concern you?\nSo don\u2019t DM me and don\u2019t send me any kind of messages (and I really need you to listen this time).

        "body": "\n\n1 Sep 2020\nBeyond tired: Part 2\n\nI debated writing this or tweeting it but I\u2019d rather it be in my online possession. I tweeted this yesterday and people have reached out since, which I\u2019m grateful for. I\u2019m not in a state that warrants therapy or someone professional to speak to but I know my options if necessary. My tiredness is fundamentally two-fold:\n\nPersonal stuff I won\u2019t go into because it\u2019s\u2026 personal.\nRacism against Black people\n\nNot gonna discuss #1 but I will talk about #2. It\u2019s very difficult to be aware of the fact that your identity evokes a rage in other people to the point they want you to be dead. Or severely injured. Or to suffer a lifetime of abuse, financial difficulties, and destitution. But it\u2019s not as explicit as that some days. Other times, it\u2019s a socially acceptable ignorance that, if you criticise, you receive a barrage of abuse or the flicker of a gaslight that burns brighter with every response. And it takes an ounce of your strength until you have none left. I\u2019ve been running on empty for months. Time away only lasts so long. Talking only works for so long if at all. Focussing on other things only masks it for so long. When will other people make the effort? Why do I have to listen and give resources for them to learn? Why, when they had an opportunity to really DO something, they decided a black square on Instagram was all they could muster, only to take it down a few weeks later when it fucked up their arbitrary grid system? And when you call them out?\n\n\u201cAt least they did something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI need some time away to collect my thoughts and come up with the right words.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cInsert single emoji here.\u201d\n\nWhat am I meant to do with that? Buried amongst the tiredness is a burning desire to scream in the ears of the ignorant so they can feel just one ounce of my anger and frustration. If the bare minimum is too much for you, get the hell out of my space. The historical evidence is in front of your face and the work has always been there to do. But no, you need an invite or someone to check your work. I will not comfort you when you apologise when my comfort has been a second class citizen for so long. You will listen to me now. And I am tired and hurting. Every day.\nI want to be left alone to live and do what I want and need to do and not find out Black people are dying or being denied basic quality of life because of White supremacy. I want White people to face up to their privilege and their place in that White supremacist system and do all they can to break it from within\u2014that\u2019s not for me and those Black superheroes to do by default. I want Black women and Black trans people to have a safe environment to be themselves and fuck shit up in every sense of the word. I want them to be paid double the amount a mediocre White man gets because they deserve it. Call it reparations.\nBut until that happens, I\u2019ll have to find a way to deal with whatever this is. And when someone asks how I am, I\u2019ll find a new line to give them, delete it, and settle for \u201ctired but alive\u201d.\nTagged as:\nracism life Black \n\nBeyond tired Proust Questionnaire - 2020\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nThe Problem With Google ItWander in PortoLast Name Jazz, First Name Hugh [Playlist]The Numbers Game: Roger Federer\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n29 Aug 2020\nBlack Panther and therapy\n\nI went to therapy last year.\nIt came after a break up that opened old wounds and I needed someone to talk to and guide me out. In one of the sessions, I retold a story that had happened a few days prior. I was amongst friends and acquaintances at a pub when I overheard a conversation about Black Panther. The person leading the conversation claimed it was the worst MCU movie because of its implausibility, particularly Shuri\u2019s technical abilities as a 16 year old. I seethed in silence but it was bad enough that I spent most of my hour talking about why it made me so angry and why Black Panther meant so much to me. My (White) therapist was very receptive and agreed with my reasoning, which I didn\u2019t expect and welcomed.\nThe fact I felt so strongly about this movie that I brought it up as the focal point of a counselling session meant it had gone beyond so many other films I\u2019d seen in my life. Not even my favourite movie of all time, Batman Returns, a film I\u2019ve seen at least three times a year since I was 3, would come close in my soul.\nBut it hasn\u2019t been enough to dispel the spectre of White supremacy. After Chadwick Boseman\u2019s death, I felt myself searching in my mind for evidence that I wasn\u2019t performing at being sad. \u201cBlack Panther did have that effect on me, right? I didn\u2019t just immerse myself in it recently?\u201d that\u2019s what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. \u201cdied\u201d in Infinity War\u2014actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now). And yet, I still had to confirm that I wasn\u2019t pretending.\nI put that down to the chokehold of White supremacy, making me second guess my identity as a mixed race Black man. You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I\u2019ve always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn\u2019t belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn\u2019t crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we could achieve.\nAnd that\u2019s why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people. As someone who works on the Internet for a living, I have a professional and moral duty to do something about it. And so I do.\nBlack Panther wasn\u2019t the first time I felt Black but it put my soul in the right place and enriched it.\nThank you, Chadwick.

        "body": "\n\n18 Feb 2019\nWhat is blackness?\n\nIs it a closed question? Can it be worn like a winter coat or a pair of cool sunglasses? Does it give owners freedom of their cities? Can it even be explained in a length of text? Blackness is everything and it is nothing. It is a weaponised concept and it is a blanket of community. In the right hands, those tired hands passed down by ancestors, it can revolt and rejoice through the pain of its history. In the wrong hands, those clean hands of oppressors, its coloured connotations are brought to the forefront; darkness, blacklisted, blacked out, evil. It is misconstrued as a binary system - the one drop rule has never died, just changed its visage. There is no percentage competition with blackness but it is used as such. What is \u201cHALF-caste\u201d really? There are gradients to this rhetoric but blackness isn\u2019t a rhetoric. No one can \u201cspeak\u201d in Blackness as a single entity for the truth is blackness is composed of numerous planes. The fact I speak of Blackness now in this language \u2013 my native tongue \u2013 betrays its true origins and yet represents its history so well. The English language is a melting pot of others, tracing centuries of raping and pillaging from other lands, taking words and refashioning them as \u201cloan words\u201d that have never been returned (much like artefacts of Blackness on those English language museums). The words I utter to describe this unfathomably large concept were given to my ancestors by force but without those words, I could not sit down to speak of Blackness. What a conundrum!\nBut I must refine them. I must celebrate the champions of Blackness from centuries ago, in the present, and what lies in the future. For those who suffered, suffer, and will suffer after me. It is crucial to inform that Blackness is not a proportion of melanin. Skin colour is a vice we all hold but it is not a defining rod or rule of judgement. Blackness transcends this all. But I am not equipped to be that judge. There are anthologies of work that can do better than me. I am merely a sentence worth. But with one sentence comes another, into a paragraph, a page, a chapter, a book, a series, a shelf, a library. This is the power of Blackness. To start from so small, under the foot of the oppressors and shout what we feel and what should be heard. This is what fuels movements like Black Lives Matter \u2013 because they all matter and this is why. The anger you see and hear? It is valid and necessary. It cannot be destroyed or extinguished as that would break the laws of the conservation of energy, laws we all follow. Covering up blackness is futile. Weaponising it has consequences, more severe with time. For those who suffer them (and I loathe to use the word \u201csuffer\u201d in this context), they must learn the hard way. But it is necessary.\nI feel I have rambled. The truth is I cannot define blackness into a neat dictionary term. That would be the most heinous crime; an assault committed by oppressors who point to the book to prove they aren\u2019t racist. But that book is written by them. \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house\u201d said Audre Lorde. How can we determine whether the tools of Black people are truly ours or those of the master? That perhaps is another question and another I cannot answer. But we can certain refrain from using the most overt devices. Repurpose and refresh. We have achieved relative success in the form of language. I admire the reversal of meaning in the English language. It fascinates and saddens me in equal measure. The sadness comes from its use by non-Black people to attack or profit. Or complete ignorance in the form of active erasure. Why should Chaucer and Shakespeare be lauded and rappers be denigrated? They are modern-day griots and their stories use said master\u2019s tools with such brilliance to attack them.\nTagged as:\nBlack \n\nEight 24 Hour Virus\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBeyond tired: Part 2Artistic InspirationsMy New Obsession Is...

All you bloggers out there, or spouses of bloggers, what effects do you notice?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s about self-expression (alongside self-experimentation). I work as an SEO for 35 hours a week so my entire career revolves around the Web. But there are limits to what I can do with that because I have responsibility to my employer and my clients. Outside those hours, I can blog about anything I want and say whatever I want (within reason of course). If I want to write a blog post comprised of a single sentence or a sole image, I can. I love that freedom and it took me a while to fully embrace it.\nAs for tolerance to human differences, I\u2019m quite the opposite because human differences often involve oppression and I refuse to tolerate that in any form. I don\u2019t blog about things I don\u2019t agree with because plenty of other people do that and that\u2019s not what I blog for. People may allude that to an echo chamber but it\u2019s my party and I\u2019ll blog what I want to\u2014notably what I believe in with conviction.\nThe effects of all of this is a change in how I consume media and how I engage with it. I tweeted last night how my connection with Twitter, and social media in general, had diminished. I don\u2019t read my TL as much as specific lists that give me exactly what I want and nothing more. It saves me doomscrolling and I can be online without wishing I wasn\u2019t (as much). Blogging is my outlet and escape from whatever the hell is happening out there and it has saved me during this pandemic.\nTagged as:\nblogging \n\n100th Blog Post 1 Year Later\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBeachedMy Albums of the Year: 2011They don't see us as humanLink dump #1\n\n\n\n\n",

But I made significant connections that got me into a line of work that met my needs and I\u2019ve been able to flourish on my own terms, which I\u2019m immensely grateful for.\nBlogging in its most perceived form isn\u2019t what it used to be (now more affiliate/commercial vs. journaling/niche community writing, although the latter never died) but it\u2019s by no means dead.\nThe one recommendation I always make when asked how to get into digital marketing is get a website. A blog is an easy way to do that (remember a blog is just a website). It\u2019s not about \u201cno one will read it\u201d. Most won\u2019t. But it should primarily be for you as it has been for me.\nI write whatever the hell I want without thought for search volumes and that\u2019s why ranking for anything is amazing to me.

My head is never cold.\nWith each one, I get the following feeling:\n\nSampleface: hard hat - writing reviews of any kind is difficult as I struggle to find words to describe music. More \u201cgeneric\u201d stuff is easier to write about so I gravitate towards that when I update the site.\nCultrface: wide brim fedora - I get more excited about writing for Cultrface because the gamut is so wide. The only thing that stops me from updating it more is the the thing that stops me from writing in general. Well, things: fatigue, procrastination, anxiety, depression, the fact I can\u2019t churn out amazing content in 5 minutes so what\u2019s the point. The usual.\nLOGiCFACE: chullo - I need to be in the mood to write about STEM. It\u2019s definitely not a lack of ideas, just a lack of motivation and mood. I actually get traffic for some niche topics so the impetus should be there. But for reasons why it isn\u2019t, see above.\nPlayrface: Nike Dri-fit Head Tie, I get a similar feeling writing for Playrface as I do for Cultrface despite lacking critical or technical knowledge of sport. I know what I know and most of it is about tennis and soccer. Anything else I\u2019m just curious and write about those curiosities. Most of the content is about Federer or Championship Manager and the latter brings in the most traffic. Go figure.\n\nI have other blogs. They rarely get updated due to extreme versions of the above problem. And this one just gets random musings when I can be bothered. Like this one. No hat required.

But it soon became apparent we weren\u2019t all in this together, if \u201cwe\u201d meant everyone on Earth. Why? Because the gulf between rich and poor grew even deeper as corporations like Amazon and Apple earnt billions as more people fell further below the poverty line.\nThen I remember seeing varations of the following phrase:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the same storm but we\u2019re not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nThat made a lot more sense. The rich were in their yachts (figuratively and literally) while everyone else was struggling to get through in their proverbial sailboats, weather-beaten and close to destruction.\nBut as time has gone on and multi-billionaires trade their boats for spaceships, I begin to wonder\u2026 are they even in the same storm now? Yeah, there are vaccines and\u2014depending on what country and demographic you observe\u2014vaccination rates are increasing but the pandemic is still here, infection rates are increasing again, and things are opening up at the same time.

And I don\u2019t think you can count on Google to fact-check for you. Just look at YouTube\u2019s suggestion algorithms.\n\nAll that said, I still believe that AI-generated content can be a useful tool, but the best content creators will still have the workflows in place, build credibility (E-E-A-T), and use it ethically.\n\nWhat say you?\n\nTo which my responses were:\n\nAgreed, and as an industry we should do more to give balanced approaches like this and highlight the potentially harmful aspects with as much weight as we give to all the \u201cinteresting\u201d use cases.\n\nAnd (in reference to whether the good will outweigh the bad for large language models):\n\nI think the hands that this tech is in currently (the ones with the most power) will tip the scales towards the bad. I\u2019m not trusting of major world leaders and their governments in any case but there needs to be SOMETHING in place and it needs to involve not just the CEOs of these AI companies and their biggest investors but with non-C-suite practitioners too (with as little bias as possible to avoid poisoning the well further). Any loopholes and it\u2019ll get worse.\n\nI also think that in our industry, we cannot ignore any of that because it is all intricately linked. Without people and search engines, SEO has very little to go on (if anything, arguably but that\u2019s another story for another day lol). So it\u2019s up to us to be as open, transparent, and balanced as possible with a people-first approach to everything\u2014as it should always be, regardless of this emergent technology.\n\nTagged as:\nAI \n\n8 Things I Learnt In My 4th Year As A Professional SEO We are not data points.

It is also true.\nIt is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn\u2019t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, \u201creality\u201d TV shows. What you see isn\u2019t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren\u2019t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we\u2019re still told it\u2019s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it\u2019s real but it\u2019s not real at the same time.\nThis kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the \u201cdevelopment of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals\u201d. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one\u2019s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.\nThe simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn\u2019t real and that it was just a programme. This isn\u2019t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said \u201ccut\u201d, the \u201cdead\u201d person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.\nThis proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn\u2019t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying \u201cunreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world\u201d, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.\nI have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and \u201cinteract\u201d. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It\u2019s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I\u2019ve done it in the past, I\u2019m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these \u201cpersonas\u201d are shed and don\u2019t pass through.\nThe whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don\u2019t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called \u201cleet speak\u201d in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn\u2019t perceived to be warranted (I\u2019ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique \u201clanguage\u201d to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.\nDavid Boyle\u2019s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn\u2019t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don\u2019t have to listen to a word I\u2019ve said. These aren\u2019t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation. So that begs the question: is this a blog post or the image of a blog post?\nTagged as:\nblogging \n\nYou rocked my world, you know you did\u2026 My Albums of the Year: 2011\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nRelease Notes #912 Things I Learnt In My 3rd Year As A Professional SEOArtistic InspirationsUnusual side effect\n\n\n\n\n",

All the news and rumours and hysteria and jokes about COVID-19 are getting too much and it\u2019s downright depressing. I\u2019m annoyed by the response to the virus from the government and other authorities that directly affect me. Peoples\u2019 lives aren\u2019t the primary concern and it\u2019s disgusting and very telling. But that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say on that.\nI\u2019m also not feeling 100% (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the virus) and I\u2019m \u201cself-isolating\u201d this weekend. All I\u2019ve done today is watch YouTube and occasionally eaten and drunk but I do need to drink more. By doing that, I\u2019ve ignored everything on TV and social media and it\u2019s reminded me that future isolation won\u2019t be so bad for me. I also realised that I have a high level of privilege for feeling that way.\nTime published an article called Why the Coronavirus Outbreak Could Hit Women Hardest discussing the harmful effects of isolation from the virus for women at risk from domestic violence. It\u2019s a subsection of society most of us - including me - won\u2019t have thought about. There are also people most at risk of catching the virus and suffering further health complications. COVID-19 has already killed nearly 6,000 people at the time of writing. As I sit in my flat, I think of all those people.

        "body": "\n\n15 Feb 2019\nEight\n\nI wrote about this on Instagram but thought I\u2019d put it here too. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve written a blog post. Sometimes I feel like writing but the motivation leaves me like air from a balloon. But this is worthy of prose. I\u2019ll start from the beginning.\nUniversity is full of clich\u00e9s: students never wash, never show up for lectures, waste their maintenance grants, eat nothing but super noodles, party all night, cram last minute, scrape 2:1s and 2:2s. The end. Some or all may apply to some or all students. Some applied to me. My first attempt at a university degree ended after 6 months. My official line was \u201cit wasn\u2019t how I expected\u201d. I\u2019d picked computer science because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it as a graphic designer. The truth was external voices made me think that. I stopped focussing on everything in college by my final year. I didn\u2019t get the grades I should have. I put too much emphasis on creating a social life and a pseudo-extroverted version of myself. That also played a part in my aborted stint at university. It all stopped by the time I was 22/23.\nBut my second attempt was successful. I tried for a graphic design degree but the interviewer suggested a foundation course. My other option was a 3-year music technology degree. No interview required. It combined the technological aspect from computer science and, of course, music. My choice was obvious. First year was a breeze but second year was more serious. I needed to try and make connections before I left. In the summer, I got in touch with a record label looking for a digital media assistant. Coincidentally, a long-time friend was also working there. They invited me to the office and I got thrown in the deep end. I arrived with full blown hay fever symptoms. My nose was streaming and I was running out of tissues fast. But I survived and I got the job. I spent the next year there between lectures and seminars. It started out with admin and later progressed into blog writing and ad-hoc design work. I became a jack of all trades and enjoyed working with friends and laughter. I was living the dream. But all good things must come to an end and they did. The company was haemorrhaging money. Wages weren\u2019t paid, solicitors came, friends left. I didn\u2019t pursue legal action but I left after a week of non-payment and never went back.\nI stole one of their Twitter accounts as moral payback and transformed it into something of my own. But before I left, I started work on a blog and called it Sampleface. The name came from a friend who used it to describe the face you make when you hear a song you think you could sample. We worked on it together and after we all parted ways, I continued writing for it. I enjoyed immersing myself in the music and the writing. Music had saved me from spiralling depression I\u2019d developed at uni the first time. It was all so cathartic and exciting. But I couldn\u2019t find any paid work in a similar way. I graduated with a 2:1 and went on to work in a post office. I kept writing. My then-girlfriend helped and organised interviews with artists. I got to speak to some of my idols and even met one for a face-to-face interview on my birthday weekend. I\u2019ll never forget that. But then the writing slowed down.\nA seed of doubt was planted in my mind and it never stopped growing. I was asked why I was doing what I was doing if there were other people doing the same thing. As someone who sucks at defending themselves, I didn\u2019t have a clear answer so I said nothing. And I let it get to me. Then I found a full-time job where my girlfriend lived and I moved up to Nottingham. I was drifting away from what I felt I should be doing. But I needed to eat and live.\nBut I kept on writing.\nThere was the odd freelance project here and there. Interviews that amounted to nothing. I tried but maybe not hard enough. There was time off work for stress and anxiety. A new baby on the way. Arguments and increased stress and anxiety. 2015 was hell for me. 2016 wasn\u2019t much better. My son was the only thing I lived for after he was born. But I still wrote when I found the time. And then a big life change. I moved out on my own. Writing was a weekly thing if I was lucky. It used to be a daily thing. By 2017, I\u2019d been writing for Sampleface for 5 years. I\u2019d started a couple more blogs in that time.\nAnd then a breakthrough.\nA friend contacted me about a possible freelance project. And paid. I was working part time and the money came in handy. It also meant some writing experience. I used some of the money to go on holiday for my birthday week. It was one of the greatest weeks of my life. I found a new flat. I did a digital marketing course and passed. I was \u201cqualified\u201d now. 2017 felt like hell but in hindsight it was a positive year. 2018 wasn\u2019t. There were more rejections, doubts over my direction, work was eating away at me. I needed to get out but nobody wanted me. I moved departments and that helped but it wasn\u2019t enough. New year came, I stayed in. I didn\u2019t make any new year\u2019s resolutions. \u201cQue sera, sera\u201d as they say.\nAnd then another breakthrough.\nI was shopping in Wilko of all places and I got a call. It was a mobile number I didn\u2019t recognise and I assumed it was an agency. I\u2019d had a million calls from agencies amounting to nothing and hesitated. But I answered. A company were looking for a copywriter. It would involve writing about online gambling. The freelance project I worked on in 2017 was all about online gambling. This was great but I played it down. I made this my last chance. First interview went well, or as well as I think it could have. That\u2019s the problem with interviews \u2013 you can think it went okay and then you don\u2019t get it. They called me back for a second interview and asked me to complete a task. The second interview felt worse than the first. I panicked for the rest of the day thinking I\u2019d blown it. But I hadn\u2019t. I got the call to say I got the job. I didn\u2019t know what to say. The waiting and working had finally paid off.\nAnd then I realised something. Every move I\u2019d made, post I\u2019d written, people I\u2019d spoken to \u2013 they had all lead me here. It often feels like a clich\u00e9 to say everything you do leads you to where you are but it\u2019s true. I felt pangs of regret that I hadn\u2019t pursued maths at college, at least with serious intent. I felt like my degree was a waste. But it lead me to this job. Had I not studied, I wouldn\u2019t have looked for the job at the label. I wouldn\u2019t have made music, wouldn\u2019t have started the blog, made friends with the guy who put me onto the freelance project that gave me the experience that helped me get the job. It all linked. I\u2019m reading this back and wondering if this is all too flowery; self-indulgent. Congratulations, you got a job, what\u2019s the big deal? Well, it is a big deal to me. I put myself down way too much. But now\u2019s the time to acknowledge my achievements. Why did I call this post \u201cEight\u201d? Because it took me 8 years to get to where I wanted to be. I joked to a colleague that I\u2019d made it out of Shawshank and that\u2019s how it felt. who I crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side (metaphorically of course). I finally had an answer to the question I couldn\u2019t answer. I\u2019ve been writing for Sampleface now for 7 years this year. It\u2019s not as popular as it used to be but I still write. Nothing will stop me writing bar a loss of upper extremities. I like to inform, to exhibit, and to teach. And it gets me where I need to go.\nTagged as:\nlife \n\nHow To Use Twitter Lists To Reduce Your Following Count What is blackness?\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nToday is a special dayI'm an Emptygold BloggerMy Phone HistoryLast Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend\n\n\n\n\n",

But for every successful business, there have been a lot of failures which would have bankrupted or otherwise ruined other businesses\u2013or people for that matter (and they probably have but why spoil a successful capitalist story).\nIn a recent work interview, I was asked what success looked like for me. It felt like a more helpful version of \u201cwhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d and I found it easier to answer. But for a while, I\u2019ve thought about the epic failures from the likes of Disney, Apple, Microsoft, and Sir Richard Branson (to name a few) and how they\u2019ve been glossed over because they\u2019re worth trillions between them. Even if those failures were proportionally scaled to smaller businesses or people, they\u2019d be seen as cautionary tales and seen for what they were - failures.\nWhy is failure seen as admirable risk-taking for some people but comical mismanagement for others? If we\u2019re asked to define our own successes, we should be able to define our own failures and there shouldn\u2019t be a hierarchal disparity.\nI\u2019ve focussed a lot on business for these examples but it might be clearer to see the differences when we look at politics. Take a look at Boris Johnson. His failures have involved the deaths of thousands of people, racism against thousands more, and a general apathy towards people who aren\u2019t rich Tories (emphasis on rich because he doesn\u2019t give a shit about working or middle class Tory voters despite the rhetoric). Now look at Diane Abbott, a Black woman and trailblazing MP who is seens as incompetent and foolish for merely existing. People take pride in laughing at her and pointing at her faults and the moment you point out the misogynoir, they get heated and play the reverse race card.\nIf we\u2019re going to define our successes or failures, we need to take into account:\n\nThe effect on ourselves\nThe effect on other people\nWhat we accomplished\nWhat we learnt\nProbably some other stuff I\u2019ve forgotten because I\u2019m not a sage\n\nIf you\u2019ve harmed people at any point is not a cause for celebration. Morals cannot be separated from business because business involves people at its fundamental level. The same for politics, sport, art, literature, food and drink, tech, everything. Let\u2019s focus one of the top failures in society right now: looking after people properly. Those successful people and companies have pillaged lives that will never come remotely close to that success and that is a monumental failure that has to be seen for what it is.

A lot of great music came out in a year where it would have been acceptable to curl into a ball and not want to create anything. But my favourite artists did and produced some of their best works to date.\nThe list below isn\u2019t a ranked list, although the top 7 are my overall top 7 for the year in a rough order. Ag\u00fcita is for sure my #1 and Mordechai is a very close second. Knxwledge\u2019s 1988 was so damn good, as was Ahwlee\u2019s VII which was like a hip hop RKO outta nowhere. The biggest surprise was Maelo Ruiz\u2019s La Unica, a salsa album I would never have found if it wasn\u2019t for a Python script I created (I might publish it some day).\nAnyway, enjoy and buy them if you can!\n\nGabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano \u2013 Ag\u00fcita\nKhruangbin \u2013 Mordechai\nKnxwledge \u2013 1988\nAhwlee \u2013 VII\nJessie Ware \u2013 What\u2019s Your Pleasure?\nDua Lipa \u2013 Future Nostalgia\nNick Hakim \u2013 WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD\nBlu & Exile \u2013 Miles\nKamaal Williams \u2013 Wu Hen\nVanilla \u2013 Into the Dream\nRina Sawayama \u2013 SAWAYAMA\nEmily King \u2013 Sides\nXavier Om\u00e4r \u2013 if You Feel\nSAULT \u2013 Untitled (Black Is)\nYoungs Teflon \u2013 Call of Duty 3\nJahari Massamba Unit \u2013 Pardon My French\nLaura Marling \u2013 Song For Our Daughter\nKing Krule \u2013 Man Alive!\nBaxter Dury \u2013 The Night Chancers\nJames Beckwith \u2013 Long Distance\nElzhi \u2013 Seven Times Down Eight Times Up\nTame Impala \u2013 The Slow Rush\nMaelo Ruiz \u2013 La Unica\nBartees Strange \u2013 Live Forever\n\nTagged as:\naoty \n\nFailure Beyond tired: Part 3\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nKamala Harris is still a copWhat's the obsession with folding phone?Morsel #5: Black fabricThe Luke 100\n\n\n\n\n",

I used to feel really empowered and inspired when I worked on my music or wrote for Sampleface until one day I was questioned about it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in doing it if other people are doing the same thing?\u201d\n\nFor a sensitive soul like me who takes rejection badly - especially when it comes from a family member - that really hurt and I\u2019ve never felt the same since. It\u2019s the classic tale of \u201cif you\u2019ve not got a natural aptitude for it, don\u2019t bother because there are better people out there and you\u2019ll never reach their heights.\u201d It hasn\u2019t stopped me completely but it has contributed to many creative ruts since. Sampleface isn\u2019t nearly as prolific as it was in the first couple of years and my music doesn\u2019t reach the same number of listeners as it did back then. Add anxiety and low self esteem to the mix and you end up with guilt.\nI love music - creating, listening, and writing about it. But there\u2019s always something at the back of my mind questioning whether I\u2019m just wasting my time. I don\u2019t need constant validation but because of that nagging voice in my head, it feels like I\u2019m playing songs into a void. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter how many people enjoy what I do, I have to enjoy it myself otherwise there is absolutely no point in doing it. And I do. I just feel guilt beforehand and I want that to dissipate.\nTagged as:\nblogging life \n\nMy Week In Lisbon The Luke 100\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nWander in PortoSaddam Hussein had a Bacon number of 3Black survival is Black excellence1 Year Later\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "11 Feb 2020",
        "body": "\n\n11 Feb 2020\n19 Things I Learnt In My First Year As A Professional SEO\n\nI\u2019m a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.\nI wrote about my journey in digital marketing when I got my job. Here is what I\u2019ve learnt in my first year as a professional.\nPeople\nWomen in SEO are the best\nWhen I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren\u2019t white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\nI\u2019ve learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I\u2019m grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.\nExperts aren\u2019t experts\nI followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won\u2019t name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of \u201cexpert\u201d opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I\u2019m not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn\u2019t have a place in search.\nThere\u2019s still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)\nI used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn\u2019t see any people like me. It didn\u2019t bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.\nAnd now I\u2019m \u201cin\u201d, I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word \u201cdiversity\u201d now as it\u2019s lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that\u2019s how capitalism works.\nThere\u2019s still a sexism problem. It\u2019s not as bad as it used to be but there\u2019s still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.\nbrightonSEO\nA friend of mine went to brightonSEO one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I\u2019m going again this year, with more experience under my belt.\nI loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year\u2019s being just as good if not better.\nKeywords\nIt\u2019s about topics, not individual keywords\nI spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.\nSuddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines.\nRanking for a targeted keyword was my highlight\nI\u2019ve been blogging for over a decade and most of the time, I don\u2019t write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)\nTechnical\nTechnical SEO is my strong suit\nI used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I\u2019ve honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that\u2019s where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.\nPython is amazing\nI know HTML isn\u2019t a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: C++. I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn\u2019t for me. And now I hate C++.\nLater on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I\u2019ve already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about Python\u2019s potential in paid search.\nI\u2019ve still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.\nJavaScript is overused\nThis has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing\u2026 it\u2019s just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn\u2019t the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).\nDoes a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I\u2019m not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn\u2019t the solution to everything on the Web.\nAPIs are amazing\nIs there anything APIs can\u2019t do? Actually, don\u2019t answer that.\nAn API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself \u201cdoes this have an API\u201d and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. Pok\u00e9mon and Spotify are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They\u2019re a great way to practise in your language of choice.\nContent and Links\nUse headings more\nMy scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.\nHeadings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they\u2019re not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don\u2019t help with ranking).\nThe inverted pyramid model is a good idea\nThe inverted pyramid model is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you\u2019ll read more. I\u2019ve heard naysayers claim TL;DR\u2019s kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as featured snippets), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they\u2019re ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.\nThere\u2019s a lot of the same content out there\nToday, I found an article called Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:\n\nThere\u2019s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you\u2019ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, \u201cSEO content\u201d has become a synonym for meandering \u201cultimate guides\u201d and formulaic \u201c7 ways\u201d listicles.\n\nWhen analysing the SERPs for intent, we\u2019re told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the \u201cbest\u201d content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there\u2019s more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there\u2019s a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.\nInternal linking is important\nI never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn\u2019t know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you\u2019re writing good content that links to more good content, you\u2019re going to keep a user on your site. And if it\u2019s an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.\nSo is a good architecture\nSomething else I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. Crawl depth is an issue (I\u2019m working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.\nGoogle\nGoogle is not a meritocracy\nI wrote a piece on this] so I won\u2019t repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.\nBut John Mueller is awesome\nJohn, if you\u2019re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.\nMisc\nI love the Web even more\nI\u2019ve loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School\u2019s library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it\u2019s used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.\nI love not doing SEO\nSeems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those \u201cbest practices\u201d. Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because it\u2019s not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD).\nIf I want to write about something, I\u2019ll write about it. There\u2019s no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured \u201cfor Google\u201d. My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don\u2019t rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won\u2019t let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!\nShout outs\nThank you to Natalie Arney, Ruth Everett, Ronke Lawal, Tony Randall, Tom Mortimer, Jess Kirkbride, Danielle Strouther, Amber Dawson, Areej AbuAli, Dan Rice, Tatiana Mac, Maret Reutelingsperger, and other people I\u2019ll invariably add later on.

        "body": "\n\n4 Mar 2023\n8 Things I Learnt In My 4th Year As A Professional SEO\n\nToday marks the fourth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (read about my first year, my second year), and my third year).\nHere is what I\u2019ve learnt in my fourth year as a professional.\nPeople\n1. SEOs still love experts, even when they pass off second-hand information\nI still get called an \u201cexpert\u201d in things. I\u2019m still grateful for the recognition in my field. I still don\u2019t personally own that accolade. Many others still do despite primarily passing off second-hand information from experts outside SEO (I\u2019m referring to AI).\nIf you want someone who knows their stuff in a different field, talk to someone in that field. Read papers, watch videos, attend conferences. Don\u2019t follow the sole advice of a \u201cSEO guru\u201d (eww, David!), and especially one that doesn\u2019t expand on the key areas of interest (such as biases and harms).\n2. John Mueller remains the MVP\nJohn, if you\u2019re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year. And the years before.\nTechnical\n3. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science continue to grow\nThese three disciplines have enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined. I have used them all fairly regularly in my professional work over the last year and they\u2019ve given me incredible insights and saved a lot of time. My next step is to standardise some of my approaches.\n4. Python still rocks and I\u2019m back in the game\nI\u2019d taken a bit of a break last year and the year before due to mental health but I\u2019m back on the Python train and creating a whole load of techniques and scripts. You can see some of them on my Morsels page above.\n5. I love web performance\nCore Web Vitals was always a bit of a stumbling block for me. Because of how it was portrayed in the industry, it felt like a necessity and could only be done one way. But having done so many audits in the last year, I\u2019ve grown to understand what matters and what doesn\u2019t.\nAnd I will say this: synthetic data (aka lab data) and RUM data (aka field data) have their places in web performance and it\u2019s important to look at both when making changes because iPhone 14 users on 5G in the UK and US aren\u2019t the only people on the internet.\nMisc\n6. Please stop using AI for bad things\nAsk yourself: will this cause harm to someone or a group of people in some way? Am I taking work away from someone who needs it? If the answer is yes, don\u2019t use AI for that thing. People should always come first in making these decicions and even if you do use AI for a task, people must be involved at every single stage.\nBecause most of AI use we see today involves some kind of model, underpinned by probabilities of the \u201cright\u201d output and put into the world with a healthy dose of confirmation bias (ie. well, I don\u2019t know how it got to that answer but this machine gave me something human-like so it must be okay).\nHallucinations can and do cause harm. Stop it. Get some (human) help.\n7. It\u2019s okay to not be okay, except all the times when it isn\u2019t\nSomething happened to me recently that shook me for a few days. It reminded me why I never used to open up to people or let myself be vulnerable and it comes down to how people throw slogans and platitudes in times of notable grief (e.g. when someone famous dies or there is a major world event) but when the dust settles, it\u2019s back to the same old lines\u2014don\u2019t do that, it makes me uncomfortable.\nBut I won\u2019t go back in my shell. When I\u2019m not okay, people who need to know will know. And those who don\u2019t because of how I\u2019ve seen them act when people around the struggle won\u2019t get my grace.\n8. The industry still isn\u2019t great and AI is gonna make it worse\nEgos are still rampant in SEO but now that we have AI, I feel like it\u2019s going to get worse. Prompt engineering is the latest craze that I\u2019ve previously tweeted about as a close analogue to Facebook\u2019s video pivot controversy. We still don\u2019t know why these prompts work in the way they do but damned if someone with an expert complex is gonna be honest about that!\nLemme just say to be careful whose words you follow as gospel. And read papers by language tech pros and ask them questions instead.\nShout outs\nThank you to:\n\nSophie Logan\nSophie Darr\nSophie Gibson\nJess Peck\nRonke Lawal\nSurena Chande\nLauren Roitman\nDave Smart\nJamar Ramos\nClarissa Ankrah\nLucky Acan\nMelissa Reynolds-Lawrence\nOlivia-Mae Foong\nLucy Robinson\nPetar Jovetic\nCharlie Norledge\nDan Taylor\nDaniel Liddle\nMarco Giordano\nChloe Ivy Rose\nRejoice Ojiaku\nWilhemina Gilbertson-Davis\n\nAnd loads of other people I\u2019ve not mentioned who have made my fourth year as an SEO a great one.\nTagged as:\nSEO AI \n\nPrompt engineering Brief LinkedIn thoughts on AI\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMy love of Sony hardware designHalt and Make FireThe Problem With Google ItHayfever and Histamines\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "12 Apr 2023",
        "body": "\n\n12 Apr 2023\nFuture Coca-Cola slogans with GPT-3.5\n\nWhile researching for a blog post about Coca-Cola, I found a list of their slogans dating as far back as 1886:\n\nList of slogans\n\n1886 - Drink Coca-Cola\n1904 - Delicious and Refreshing\n1905 - Coca-Cola Revives and Sustains\n1906 - The Great National Temperance Beverage\n1917 - Three Million a Day\n1922 - Thirst Knows No Season\n1923 - Enjoy Thirst\n1924 - Refresh Yourself\n1925 - Six Million a Day\n1926 - It Had to Be Good to Get Where It Is\n1927 - Pure as Sunlight\n1927 - Around the Corner from Everywhere\n1929 - The Pause that Refreshes \n1932 - Ice Cold Sunshine\n1938 - The Best Friend Thirst Ever Had\n1939 - Thirst Asks Nothing More\n1939 - Whoever You Are, Whatever You Do, Wherever You May Be, When You Think of Refreshment Think of Ice Cold Coca-Cola\n1942 - The Only Thing Like Coca-Cola is Coca-Cola Itself\n1948 - Where There's Coke There's Hospitality\n1949 - Along the Highway to Anywhere\n1952 - What You Want is a Coke\n1956 - Coca-Cola... Makes Good Things Taste Better\n1957 - Sign of Good Taste\n1958 - The Cold, Crisp Taste of Coke\n1959 - Be Really Refreshed\n1963 - Things Go Better with Coke\n1969 - It's the Real Thing \n1971 - I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke (part of the \"It's the Real Thing\" campaign)\n1975 - Look Up America\n1976 - Coke Adds Life \n1979 - Have a Coke and a Smile\n1982 - Coke Is It! \n1985 - We've Got a Taste for You (for both Coca-Cola & Coca-Cola classic)\n1985 - America's Real Choice (for both Coca-Cola & Coca-Cola classic)\n1986 - Red, White & You (for Coca-Cola classic)\n1986 - Catch the Wave (for Coca-Cola)\n1987 - When Coca-Cola is a Part of Your Life, You Can't Beat the Feeling\n1988 - You Can't Beat the Feeling \n1989 - Official Soft Drink of Summer\n1990 - You Can't Beat the Real Thing\n1993 - Always Coca-Cola\n2000 - Coca-Cola. Enjoy\n2001 - Life Tastes Good\n2003 - Coca-Cola ... Real\n2005 - Make It Real\n2006 - The Coke Side of Life\n2009 - Open Happiness\n2016 - Taste the Feeling\n2021 - Real Magic\n\n\nAnd that got me thinking\u2026 what would GPT-3.5 create based on those examples? So I put it in using a private \u201clite\u201d version of Oapy with the following prompt:\nCreate 10 more Coca-Cola slogans based on the following examples and following the format: [THE ABOVE LIST WENT HERE]\nI also gave it a headstart and appended the prompt with 2023 - \nThe results were:\n\n2023 - Discover the Magic of Coca-Cola\n2025 - Refresh Your World with Coca-Cola\n2027 - Share the Happiness with Coca-Cola\n2030 - The Real Taste of Life: Coca-Cola\n2032 - The Magic is in the Bottle: Coca-Cola\n2035 - Coca-Cola: The Ultimate Refreshment\n2040 - Experience the Magic of Coca-Cola\n2042 - Always Real, Always Coca-Cola\n2045 - Taste the Magic of Coca-Cola\n2050 - Unlock the Magic of Coca-Cola\n\nA little stilted. I think the latter slogans influenced the output with its use of the brand name, resulting in lifeless results. Let\u2019s try with just slogans from the 21st century:\n\n2023 - Refresh Your World\n2025 - Experience the Joy of Coke\n2027 - Spark Happiness with Coca-Cola\n2028 - Unleash the Magic of Coca-Cola\n2030 - Enjoy the Authentic Taste of Coke\n2032 - Savor the Moment with Coca-Cola\n2034 - Real Moments, Real Coca-Cola\n2036 - Experience Coke, Experience Life\n2038 - Share the Love with Coca-Cola\n2040 - The Real Refreshment You Need\n\nAnd the 80s to 90s?\n2023 -\n\nRefreshment in Every Sip (for Coca-Cola classic)\nTaste the Difference with Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola: The Classic Choice\nSatisfy Your Thirst with Coca-Cola\nThe Perfect Drink for Any Occasion\nEnjoy Coca-Cola, Enjoy Life\nA Taste of Happiness with Coca-Cola\nQuench Your Thirst with Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola: A Timeless Classic\nExperience the Flavor of Coca-Cola\n\nInterestingly, the years weren\u2019t used in this, possibly because 2023 was a large jump from 1993. Either way\u2026 it didn\u2019t make much difference.

They have the power to block, ban, and remove whatever you do and not give you an explanation. You may never get it back and there\u2019s almost nothing you can do about it. You effectively rent space and hope they don\u2019t pull the rug from under you.\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t use them (although there\u2019s a case for that which I won\u2019t go into here) but it\u2019s dangerous to only use social media platforms to showcase your work and not have any kind of backup. That\u2019s why having a website or a space you are in more/full control of is essential.\nPlaces like Twitter, Instagram, et al should be extending tools and platforms. It\u2019s not wise to decentralise your art and give the responsibility to third parties who don\u2019t have your best interests at heart. Get that website, make it your main hub, and use other platforms are offshoots. The best case scenario would be to create your own site from scratch but that\u2019s not accessible to everyone so here\u2019s a list of options:\nWeb builders/blog platforms\n\nSquarespace\nWordPress.com/WordPress.org\nWix\nShopify\nWebflow\nGator from Hostgator\nCargo\n\nWeb hosts\n\nIONOS\nKrystal\nBluehost\nDigital Ocean\nHostGator\nHostinger\nGreenGeeks\nDreamHost\nHostPapa\n\nAll of the above options have an element of risk. You could still lose your work or have it taken down as you\u2019re still renting space (and paying for it this time). That can make it less viable than using a free social media platform. So weigh up the pros and cons and what you want to create and showcase and whether it\u2019s worth it to you. Then, gain control back. Well, more than you had before.\nTagged as:\nthe web \n\nBack on Twitter New normal\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nA poem about how search engines can't interpret poemsI'm an Emptygold Blogger1 Year LaterLast Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n10 Aug 2020\nHalt and Make Fire\n\nOver the past week, I\u2019ve been studying early internet culture (inspired by Halt and Catch Fire) and it\u2019s really made me think about how SEO is structured now compared to back then.\nIn the early days, it was centred on discovery through search but then major corps transformed the Web into a land of online billboards and while blogging formed an anthesis, that slowly died and now we\u2019re hear, writing \u201ccontent\u201d that is only meaningful if it\u2019s over 1,000 words.\nNobody ever asks people (now defined simply as \u201cusers\u201d) their thoughts on search and the Web. Their assumed behaviour is based on whatever Google tells us and it\u2019s algorithms change their interactions rather than the other way around. That\u2019s my belief anyway. I don\u2019t have the data to prove it.\nI look at how people have reacted to COVID-19 and their submission to governments who have openly deceived their citizens. That\u2019s leads me to the conclusion that big tech companies can change their realities to make profit and \u201cprove\u201d that what they\u2019re doing is innovative and forward thinking. If the user absolves responsibility, you can control them.\nSo when I blog outside of work, I actively\u2014albeit metaphorically and morally\u2014fight Google. I\u2019ll link to whomever I want, keep my content as short or as long as I want, ignoring the possibility of it being regarded as \u201cthin content\u201d (who the fuck are they to call it thin content anyway?) I don\u2019t have clients to please. I share things I find interesting and don\u2019t let a series of biased algorithms and Big Data tell me what interesting should mean.\nThis is far from digital anarchism and I wouldn\u2019t call my blog posts forms of protest but I certainly feel better for writing what I want than what I think a multi-billion dollar enterprise will index and rank on the first page for a search query.\nTagged as:\nthe web \n\nI'm not really one for speeches so I'll just say 'thanks' Everyone's a writer\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nFuture Coca-Cola slogans with GPT-3.5Keep writing anywayRelease Notes #38 Things I Learnt In My 4th Year As A Professional SEO\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n26 Jun 2017\nHayfever and Histamines\n\nI suffer from hayfever and it kills me for 4-5 months of the year. It\u2019s got to the stage where my current max dosage of fexofenadine isn\u2019t enough. One of the best suggestions is a change in diet. Easier said than done, right? But before I give you the list, here are what histamines are and what they do:\nHistamines are neurotransmitters that can cause inflammatory responses when your immune system feels an imminent attack. As you may know, histamine can cause swelling in your blood vessels, allowing for white blood cells to find and attack the source in your body. This can lead to headaches, a flushed feeling, itchiness and miserable. Sound familiar?\nIf you want to keep the symptoms down, try cutting down or cutting out the following histamine-rich foods:\n\nFermented alcoholic beverages: beer, wine (including champagne), cider, mead, and sake\nFermented foods and sauces: sauerkraut, vinegar, soy sauce, and yogurt\nCured meats: bacon, salami, pepperoni, luncheon meats, and hot dogs\nSoured foods: sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, soured bread\nDried fruit: apricots, prunes, dates, figs, raisins\nMost citrus fruits\nAged cheese including goat cheese\nNuts: walnuts, cashews, and peanuts\nVegetables: avocados, eggplant, spinach, and tomatoes\nSmoked fish and certain species of fish: mackerel, tuna, anchovies, and sardines\n\nThere are also these foods and drinks that can release histamines:\n\nbananas\ncow\u2019s milk and products containing cow\u2019s milk\nstrawberries\nwheatgerm\n\nNow, I'm not a doctor and don't profess to be one so consulting your doctor would be the best solution. All diets are different and some foods are more important for your health than others so always check with a professional first. This is merely a list of foods for consideration. There are foods that can help reduce the symptoms due to their lower levels of histamines:\n\ngreen herbs\napples\ncucumbers\nfresh meat and fish\nfresh fruit and veg (not on the lists above)\ngrains like rice, yeast free bread, oats\ngluten-free pasta\nmilk substitutes \u2013 coconut milk, rice milk, and almond milk\nherbal teas \u2013 except green tea\n\nIt's also worth mentioning to avoid ready meals and foods containing preservatives. In a nutshell (but not literally of course), fresh food cooked from scratch is your best bet to avoid histamines. Again, easier said than done in this day and age but it can really help you cope through a tough season. You don't want to stay indoors all summer, right?\n(Information obtained from mindbodygreen and Histamine Intolerance. To reiterate, always consult a medical professional before undertaking changes in diet and take particular care of other allergies you may have.)\nTagged as:\nhayfever illness \n\nRIP MJ - 8 Years On I am...\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nVideos I've been watching to keep me goingMorsel #7: Random Pok\u00e9mon Team GeneratorBlack and TiredPublic health\n\n\n\n\n",

Here\u2019s how I did it.\n1. Get the data\nTo get this data, you need the Last.fm API and an account. With my credentials, I wrote a script that scraped the data and created a JSON file out of it:\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport datetime\n\npayload = {\n  'api_key': API_KEY,\n  'format': 'json',\n  'limit': 1000,\n}\n\nr = requests.get('https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.gettopartists&user=USERNAME', params=payload)\n\nres = r.json()\n\nfor key in range(0,len(res['topartists']['artist'])):\n    \n    # Change playCount from str to int\n    res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'] = int(res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'])\n\n    res['last updated'] = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%d %B %Y')\n\nwith open('../data/lastfm.json', \"w+\") as f:\n    json.dump(res, f, indent=4)\nThis created a lastfm.json file. I also included a key for the date when I update the file so I can display that on the page. Now there\u2019s time to use the Fetch API.\n2. Fetch the data\nI use the Fetch API for my wiki pages to pull data from my other WordPress blogs via the REST API. In this case, I\u2019m pulling from a local JSON file so I start by importing the file:\nimport lastfm from '../data/lastfm.json';\nThen I use .map() to map the rank, artist, and playcount to a table.\n<p>Last updated: {lastfm['last updated']}</p>\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Pos.</th>\n        <th>Artist</th>\n        <th>Playcount</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n  {lastfm.topartists.artist.map((item) => (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{item['@attr'].rank}</td>\n      <td><a href={item.url}>{item.name}</a></td>\n      <td>{item.playcount.toLocaleString()}</td>\n    </tr>\n  ))}\n  </table>\nA couple of things to note: lastfm.topartists.artist.map gets all the artist data and item.playcount.toLocaleString() converts the playcount and adds a thousands comma seperator.\nAnd that\u2019s it.

        "body": "\n\n24 Aug 2020\nHow much do my blogs cost?\n\nAs I continue working on my microscopic media empire (stolen from Jason Kottke but also other people), I asked myself: whow much does it cost to run all my blogs and various mini projects. I decided to keep it easy and calculate all the outgoings in 2020 so far and income I get from Patreon to calculate the gross and net costs.\nTL;DR \u2013 it costs me money so please consider becoming a patreon.\nNote: unfortunately, as I\u2019m not an accountant and don\u2019t have one, these figures won\u2019t be exact due to currency conversion (I get paid in dollars from Patreon so my final conversion will be after deductions)\nSo, in 2020, according to my IONOS invoices, I have spent \u00a3174.66 inc. VAT. Those costs are made up of domain names (new and renewals) and monthly web hosting fees (which used to be quarterly but recently changed). I was stunned. That\u2019s a lot of money.\nIn terms of Patreon income, in 2020 so far, I have made $134.01 of which I donated $63 to Black charities. That brings the net income to $71.01 which is \u00a354.16.\nThat means I come out with -\u00a3120.50 and 2020 isn\u2019t finished yet. This is why I\u2019ve ramped up the requests for donations and Patreon pledges. I love what I do but it costs me money. Besides Patreon going towards the costs for domains and web hosting, I want it to go towards my time doing it all and I\u2019d hope that the people who are and want to pledge enjoy the content as well. Most of the traffic I get is from Google searches so I never get to see or hear from those people directly. I\u2019ve increased the tweets I send out and social referral traffic is up significantly but, again, I don\u2019t really know who those people are (so thank you but feel free to chat to me about what I write for that sweet hit of validation).\nI don\u2019t like talking about money or going on and on about Patreon and nobody asks me about it but I believe in being transparent and open about it all so there it is.\nTagged as:\nblogging \n\nWander in Porto Things that aren't in the U.S. Constitution\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nFailureSEOicismThe Last 5 Games of the 2017 Australian Open12 Things I Learnt In My 3rd Year As A Professional SEO\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n18 Dec 2016\nIf Nobody Listened, Would I Still Make Music?\n\nGoing through my blog feed, I noticed an article from DIY Photography entitled \u201cIf nobody cared, would you still take pictures?\u201d. That\u2019s a pertinent question and something I\u2019ve often asked myself from a musical perspective.\nI started seriously making music in 2010 after undertaking a Music Tech course. I released 9 albums between 2011-2013. I was in the zone and enjoyed making the music, promoting it and the feedback I gained. My highlight was ranking #11 in Potholes In My Blog\u2019s Top 50 Instrumental Albums list which I didn\u2019t see coming at all.\nBut from late 2013, I hit a slump. I had less time to make music, a long distance relationship to maintain and found myself in a motivational rut. I tried forcing through it and that made it worse. Music production became repulsive to me; my body started rejecting the keys and the pads. In 2014, I released 2 albums. In 2015, just the one. Music was holding less of a place in my life and while I continued listening, even that was reduced.\nPart of the demotivation came from a lack of listeners. There was no sustained support after release apart from a handful of friends which I was eternally grateful for. I wasn\u2019t expecting a swathe of interviews and features but the ego within me had hoped for more. I understand now it\u2019s not just about sending a link and everyone flocks. I don\u2019t think I fully appreciated the support I was getting, looking for new followers instead.\nI\u2019m out of that mire now and I\u2019m on 3 albums and a single for this year, with a new full release slated for 2017. The important thing I take away from the experience so far leads me back to the original question: If nobody listened, would I still take music? And the answer is yes. I\u2019ll be honest and say part of me makes music for the validation in my talents. Music was never a career path I set myself from the get go. I\u2019ve had to work to get as good as I am but I need external feedback to know exactly how good that is. But ultimately, I enjoy being in that zone making music; creating something from something else or seemingly nothing at all.\nOne test of how well I\u2019ve done with a record is whether I\u2019d listen to this by someone else and the answer has always been yes. There\u2019s a lot of samey music out there, copies of the same aesthetic without pushing any kinds of boundaries. I\u2019ve become a victim of this ideology and I\u2019m definitely not a trendsetter in any way but I reckon my music is unique enough to stand out if it\u2019s heard. And sometimes it isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s okay because I\u2019m listening and I\u2019ll still make music if no one else will.\nTagged as:\nmusic me \n\nLast Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend 2017 Needs Brevity And Nuance\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nDon't delete your old work (but restore it if you do)24 Hour VirusThings to remember for 2023Future Coca-Cola slogans with GPT-3.5\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n28 Apr 2018\nI'm Racially Tired\n\nI\u2019ve taken a break from my main account on Twitter. I run about 6 others and I\u2019m still active on those but I tweet mostly from @lukealexdavis. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve taken a break but I\u2019ve decided not to deactivate this time. Why am I drawing more attention to this? Because I\u2019m tired. Whether it\u2019s the Windrush scandal, Kanye being a right-wing sympathiser, or Bill Cosby and Nas apologists, there are people who have suffered or are suffering and people out there defending them. And I\u2019m tired of all of it. I\u2019m very vocal about race on my account because I\u2019ve been subjected to my own relative experiences.\nI think my biggest bugbear right now is seeing all these issues take place and the dominant voices being white and cis. And if you call for anything else, you\u2019re \u201ccensoring\u201d. God forbid they should just shut up for once and let a member of the group being marginalised speak. I wouldn\u2019t mind but many with privilege don\u2019t even use it to speak up for those who suffer, instead deciding to make their own opinions, steal those of the disenfranchised, or play down their suffering (and then calling them out for discrimination when they get called out). And they wonder why we\u2019re angry or upset (I say \u201cwe\u201d as a cis Black man and the relative discrimination I face in as a member of that demographic only).\nMy intentions here are not selfish. This is more of a call to those in those privileged groups to think about what you say and how you say it when it comes to members of other social groups who suffer discrimination. I often say I\u2019m not some kind of expert and learn how to be better everyday. It\u2019s not about political correctness (a terribly misused phrase), it\u2019s about genuine equality and letting people live without fear of persecution. Amplify voices rather than talking over them. Listen instead of talking. Question those around you rather than enabling. They\u2019re things I learn to do everyday and if we all did, we\u2019d be on the road to a better place.\nTagged as:\nracism me Black \n\n4 Creative Article Ideas - Inspired By \"The Read\" Khruangbin & Federer\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nConnectionsRelease Notes #8My 49 Favourite Albums of 2012Boats, storms, and rockets\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "28 Feb 2022",
        "body": "\n\n28 Feb 2022\nIntroducing RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)\n\nI\u2019ve been learning Python since October 2019 and exploring NLP since the end of last year and they\u2019ve changed my life for the better. As I learn by doing, I\u2019ve decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to do it as it\u2019s very niche to me but I\u2019ve taken a step out of my comfort zone.\nGitHub link to RALTS repository\nTable of contents\n\nWhat is RALTS?\nWhy did I make it?\nNotes on my coding\nSome definitions\nTech requirements\nThe code\nWho could this benefit?\nEvaluation\nSummary\n\n What is RALTS?\nRALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it\u2019s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I\u2019ll explain those all in more detail later.\nThere is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I\u2019ll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.\nExamples:\n\nhttps://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema\nhttps://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow\nhttps://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry\nhttps://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring\nhttps://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs\n\nIn terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I\u2019m a Pok\u00e9mon fan. It\u2019s a backronym but it works for me.\nWhy did I make it?\ntl;dr: it aids my blogging process.\nI love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I\u2019m a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).\nFundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn\u2019t think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.\nNotes on my coding\nBefore I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I\u2019ve only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I\u2019ve done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven\u2019t finished. You\u2019ll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for \u201cstupid code\u201d and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).\nI also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his zero shot demo. He wrote a great piece on zero shot learning which you should read if you\u2019re interested.\nThere\u2019s also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action.\nIf I\u2019ve taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I\u2019ve forgotten to credit or if you\u2019d prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.\nSome definitions\nSo, about that original explanation. Let\u2019s look at some definitions:\n\n\nEntities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.\n\n\nTopics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \u201can automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\u201d.\n\n\nCategories - The term \u201ccategories\u201d is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising\n\n\nText classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.\n\n\nLabels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They\u2019re basically like tags.\n\n\nTech requirements\nThese are the following Python packages used in the script:\nstreamlit>=1.0.0\npandas>=1.2.3\ntransformers>=4.12.3\nrequests>=2.25.1\nbs4>=0.0.1\nplotly>=5.4.0\nnumpy>=1.18.0\ntextrazor==1.4.0\ntensorflow>=2.7.0\nStreamlit for the UI, pandas for data manipulation, Transformers for the language model, requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, plotly and NumPy for data viz, TextRazor for the entities and such, and TensorFlow for the language model.\nRegarding TensorFlow, the language model I\u2019m using is called DistilBart-MNLI and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.\nThe code\nThe code is split into different parts:\n1. TextRazor API key and client details\n# TextRazor details\ntextrazor.api_key = API_KEY\n\nclient = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=[\"entities\", \"topics\"])\nclient.set_classifiers([\"textrazor_newscodes\"])\nWe set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to textrazor_newscodes. Find out more on TextRazor\u2019s Classification page.\n2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping\n# Load model\n@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)\ndef load_model():\n  return pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\", \n  model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9', \n  multi_label=True)\n\n# Classification function\ndef classify(sequences, candidate_labels):\n  output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,\n    candidate_labels=candidate_labels)\n  return output_results['labels'], output_results['scores']\n\n# Graph plot function\ndef plot_result(top_topics, scores):\n  top_topics = np.array(top_topics)\n  scores = np.array(scores)\n  scores *= 100\n  fig = px.bar(x=scores, \n    y=top_topics,\n    orientation='h', \n    labels={'x': 'Confidence', 'y': 'Label'},\n    text=scores,\n    range_x=(0,115),\n    title='Top Predictions',\n    color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),\n    color_continuous_scale='GnBu')\n  fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)\n  fig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:0.1f}%',\n  textposition='outside')\n  st.plotly_chart(fig)\n\ndef req(url):\n  resp = requests.get(url)\n  soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')\n  if soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\") or soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\"):\n    remove_comments = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\")\n    remove_comments.extract()\n    remove_secondary = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\")\n    remove_secondary.extract()\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n  else:\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n  with st.spinner('Classifying...'):\n    global txt\n    df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)\n    df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(\n      by='Relevance Score', ascending=False)\n    classify_topic_score = list(\n      df_classify_topic['Topic'][:10])\n    if input_type == 'Text':\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'URL':\n      txt = req(url)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n      txt = ' '.join(all_txt)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n\n  plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])\nThere\u2019s a lot here so I\u2019ll break it down further.\nThe first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn\u2019t reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.\nThe second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.\nThe third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.\nHere\u2019s how the model classified this blog post:\n\nThe fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars (thanks to Jess for the help with that) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.\nThe fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.\n3. Dictionaries\nkw_dict = {\n  'Keyword': []\n}\n\nent_dict = {\n  'Keyword': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ntopics_dict = {\n  'Topic': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ncategories_dict = {\n  'Category': [],\n  'Relevance Score': []\n}\n\ntags = {\n  'Tag': [],\n  'ID': [],\n  'Count': []\n}\nArguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.\n4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists\n# Blog list\nblogs = ['sampleface.co.uk',\n\t'cultrface.co.uk',\n\t'logicface.co.uk',\n\t'playrface.co.uk',\n\t'distantarcade.co.uk']\n\n# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs\nexisting_tags = []\nall_txt = []\n\n# Upper limits for tag page range\nupper_limits = {\n  'sampleface.co.uk': 4,\n  'cultrface.co.uk': 4,\n  'logicface.co.uk': 2,\n  'playrface.co.uk': 2,\n  'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,\n  'ld89.org': 1\n}\nHere, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.\nThe tag data comes from WordPress\u2019s REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).\nAlso, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)\n5. The Streamlit UI stuff\n# Streamlit stuff\n\nst.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')\n\ninput_type = st.sidebar.radio(\n\t'Select your input type',\n\t['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])\n\nupdate_tags = st.sidebar.button('\u21bb Refresh tags')\n\ntag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')\n\n\n# Determines input types\nst.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')\nst.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')\nif input_type == 'Text':\n  txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')\n  txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('\"', '').replace('\u201c','').replace('\u201d', '').replace('\u2018','').replace('\u2019', '').replace(\"'s\", '').replace(\",\", '')\n  st.write(len(txt))\nelif input_type == 'URL':\n  url = st.text_input('Enter URL')\nelif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n  multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')\nThis displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.\n6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress\u2019s REST API\ndef update_all_tags():\n\n  with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):\n\n    for blog in blogs:\n    \n      # Get tag data\n      for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):\n\n        tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'\n        r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)\n        api_tags = r_tag.json()\n\n        for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):\n          tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])\n          tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])\n          tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])\n\n        with open(f\"{blog}.json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n          json.dump(tags, outfile)\n      tags['Tag'] = []\n      tags['ID'] = []\n      tags['Count'] = []\n\nlist_of_blogs = st.radio(\"Select the corresponding blog\", blogs)\n\n# Load JSON files\nwith open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:\n  blog_json = json.load(f)\n  x = blog_json['Tag']\n  for n in x:\n    existing_tags.append(n)\n\nsubmit = st.button('Submit')\n\nif update_tags:\n  update_all_tags()\nThere are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won\u2019t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.\nFrom there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.\n7.

Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.\nFinally, they\u2019re all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.\n8.

The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I\u2019ve used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.\nBelow is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\nKeywordRelevance ScoreExisting tagWebsite0.66200Search engine optimization0.64600Web scraping0.64500World Wide Website0.64400HTML0.63200\nA table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\nTopicRelevance ScoreExisting tagAPI1.00000Blog1.00000Computer science1.00001Computing1.00000Google Search1.00000\nAnd a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\nCategoryRelevance Scoreeconomy, business and finance>computing and information technology0.8100economy, business and finance>computing and information technology>software0.7330arts, culture and entertainment>internet0.6020arts, culture and entertainment>language0.5620science and technology>engineering0.5360\n10.

I made a pledge to write about more Black content and scripts like this keep me in check as I can fill in gaps where content is lacking. It also inspires me to learn new things I never would have found from plain searching or from the blogs I follow (also part of my process which I wrote about a few years ago).\nBut this kind of script is for any of the following types of people:\n\nTo analyse text for entity relevance\nTo find internal linking opportunities, particularly those interested in using LOD (linked open data)\nContent ideas\nTo check if your text is aligned how you want it\n\nEvaluation\nThis Python script is not perfect. It\u2019s rough around the edges and works for my specific use case so for anyone else, they would need to tweak it or potentially rewrite it for their own needs.\nOne significant change that could be made is with the use of the BART model. This isn\u2019t fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.\nThere are also no means of downloading the outputted data. This is a personal preference as I tend to read off the screen and move on but for other use cases, you may want the CSVs. That can be added in.\nSummary\nI hope this has been insightful for anyone reading. While I\u2019ve been learning Python and it makes sense to me, I appreciate it can feel daunting to take this in without the same knowledge. I rarely have to explain my personal projects and don\u2019t like to say \u201chey, I made this thing\u201d because who cares (that\u2019s what I say in my head anyway). At the very least, I can say I did a thing and explained why and it will benefit me.\nTagged as:\nPython SEO AI \n\nKeep writing anyway 12 Things I Learnt In My 3rd Year As A Professional SEO\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nThe Exclusive WebsiteIf I were a rich man #1Release Notes #6Unusual side effect\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n11 Dec 2020\nGive The Drummer Sum: J Dilla\u2019s Influence on the Modern Drummer\n\nJames Dewitt Yancey has garnered all the posthumous acclaim you\u2019d expect for a hip-hop visionary underappreciated outside of his circles. Whether it be for his impeccable choice of samples through a multitude of different styles, his uncanny knack of blowing your mind with his musicianship or his humility in a sea of egos and gold chains, he is revered as a legend beyond the realms of hip-hop music, and rightfully so. But perhaps something that he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for, publicly at least, is his drumming techniques, both acoustic and digital. The Detroit producer was mean on the MPC but his live drumming had influences on a number of his peers, particularly Questlove and Kariem Riggins, who have since helped carry his legacy on.\nThe story goes that Amp Fiddler, a fellow Detroitian, was the man who gave Dilla his first MPC. It had a minor fault and no manual at hand, but he found a way to get it working and the rest is hip-hop history. From there, he improved his craft and soon surpassed his main idols\u2014Pete Rock and DJ Premier. At Dilla\u2019s wake, Pete Rock remaked that he used to be the king but Dilla had taken the crown soon after. His technique started similarly to his peers of the time. The early \u201990s gave birth to \u201cjazz rap\u201d and the complementing drum breaks that came with it, thanks to Prince Paul and A Tribe Called Quest. By 1993, Tribe and co. had moved onto free drumming, in the pocket, classic boom bap.\nWhen it came time for Dilla to show what he had to offer on a major stage for The Pharcyde, it was 1995 and a year after what is known by fans as the \u201cSecond Golden Age\u201d period of 1993-1994. \u201cRunnin\u2019\u201d heralded the start of an illustrious career. Producing under the name \u201cJay Dee,\u201d his music triggered the attention of Q-Tip and he managed to acquire his services for Tribe\u2019s final two albums. Despite the internal strife Tribe were experiencing, Jay Dee, now performing under the collective name of The Ummah, let his music do the talking. Unlike the drum programming on Labcabincalifornia, the patterns on Beats, Rhymes & Life and The Love Movement were a lot looser, slightly off time at moments. This apparent \u201csloppiness\u201d was no accident, however. Jay was playing it human. Allowing the kicks and snares to be slightly out of time moved the percussion aware from a machine feel and gave added weight to the swing and soul of the music. The two albums he featured on weren\u2019t met with the same acclaim as the first three Tribe albums but that was more due to the ongoing strife between Tip and Phife as opposed to Jay Dee\u2019s production quality.\nQuestlove once told XXL Magazine a story of how Dilla had used a beaten up drum kit on the Donald Byrd cover \u201cThink Twice\u201d for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla had used a vibraphone mallet and a broken drumstick with toilet paper and rubber bands wrapped around it because he didn\u2019t know where to get proper drumsticks late at night. His reasoning for using a mallet was to keep the dynamic less aggressive. Questlove subsequently went out and bought orchestra mallets and tried it out when he had to fly out to Philly. Even before that time, Dilla had been instrumental (pun intended) in the rhythmic and percussive elements of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo (although not officially credited), pushing the human element of the drum programming all the way. Questlove clearly learnt a lot from this approach as his performances on the opener \u201cPlaya Playa,\u201d for example, exhibits the funky swing of the rimshot against the booming bass drum to give a distinct sound that permeated throughout the whole album. As Quest said himself, \u201cThe idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.\u201d Talking to Okayplayer, Quest remarked that \u201cWord Play\u201d on Tribe\u2019s Beats, Rhymes & Life singlehandedly changed his thinking towards drumming, because of the sloppiness of the kick, executed with \u201cfinesse and defiance.\u201c Looking at where he is right now in terms of success, that was a pretty big influence.\nBy the time Dilla\u2019s second \u201cera\u201d came around, the gritty street feel mixed with the brief beginnings of his electro phase, Karriem Riggins had already known the Detroit producer for five years, having met him through Common in \u201996. In that time, he had provided his drumming expertise on \u201c2 U 4 U\u201d and later produced \u201cThe Clapper\u201d for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla\u2019s influence on Riggins was as profound, maybe more so after the release of his debut album, Alone/Together, which featured the track \u201cJ Dilla The Greatest.\u201d \u201cI learned different ways to get certain feels out of the machine, to basically convey an idea,\u201d he told XXL Mag. \u201cTurning the time shifting off and playing the track live. I think his approach was different every time.\u201d Riggins illustrated the point further in a video with Peanut Butter Wolf and J.Rocc. Using the machine, be it a MPC or one of the newer Maschines, as a tool rather than the music maker allowed for more human flexibility in production.\nAsk most producers right now some of their main influences and you\u2019ll hear Dilla\u2019s name mentioned pretty much every time. The reason behind this may differ from musician to musician but the general crux of it comes from his approach to the whole process, from start to finish. There\u2019s also an element of curiosity; what sample did he use on that cut, how did he get the snare to sound like that without it being too brash? Video series like Waajeed\u2019s \u201cBling47 Breaks Dilla Edition\u201d answered some of those burning questions with the purpose to demystify Dilla and his production, according to Waajeed himself. Jazz drummer Damion Reid, talking to NPR Music, expressed his admiration for Dilla\u2019s ability to encompass every element within his compositions, \u201cevery drum, every nuance, every atmospheric sound was strategically placed. Jay Dee embodied, to me, the culmination of all those things.\u201d Last year, ERIMAJ released his debut album Conflict Of A Man and featured his take on Dilla\u2019s \u201cNothing Like This,\u201d one of his most enigmatic works. Drummer/producer Jamire Williams captured the essence of the original, the arena anthem percussion, while adapting it to cater to his own style with the added Rhodes and guitar.\nThe sheer number of drummers and drummers-turned-producers with some connection to Dilla through direct communication or a mutual stylistic respect is mind boggling. Dilla, the patron saint of modern day drummers.\n(originally written for Revive Music)\nTagged as:\nmusic writing J Dilla \n\nIt's binary time!

        "body": "\n\n11 Nov 2010\nReview: Jamiroquai \u2013 Rock Dust Light Star\n\n\u201cHere it is, there\u2019s no way to make it better.\u201d\nOne of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai\u2019s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star. Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I\u2019d draw the line there. It\u2019s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who\u2019ve forgotten or just didn\u2019t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai\u2019s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.\nWhat I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?\nSo here\u2019s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.\n1. Rock Dust Light Star\nThe title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn\u2019t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I\u2019m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you\u2019re a new listener, but won\u2019t blow you away.\nSimilar song: Couldn\u2019t really think of one.\nRating: 6/10\n2. White Knuckle Ride\nIt\u2019s funk, it\u2019s house, it\u2019s \u201chigh-octane\u201d, it\u2019s Jamiroquai. If it wasn\u2019t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It\u2019s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: \u201cPressure, it\u2019s not so easy to control\u201d. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.\nSimilar song: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving\nRating: 9/10\n3. Smoke and Mirrors\nSomeone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn\u2019t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It\u2019s a welcome return and it\u2019s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.\nSimilar song: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth\nRating: 8/10\n4. All Good In The Hood\nI remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn\u2019t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn\u2019t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&B (separate rant for a separate day).\nSimilar song:  Soul Education from Synkronized\nRating: 7/10\n5. Hurtin\u2019\nThis track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he\u2019s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it\u2019s their second full foray into a genre they\u2019ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I\u2019ll leave that question up to you, folks.\nSimilar song: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite\nRating: 8/10\n6. Blue Skies\nWhat\u2026 a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can\u2019t be right. Well it is. And it\u2019s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I\u2019ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren\u2019t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard people say \u201cthey sing the same stuff over and over\u201d to which I\u2019d reply \u201cyeah, because they\u2019re a funk band. You don\u2019t say that about James Brown, do you?\u201d. I haven\u2019t said that yet, but I will one day. It\u2019s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it\u2019d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it\u2019s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s definitely a radio favourite.\nSimilar song: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.\nRating: 9/10\n7. Lifeline\nThere seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It\u2019s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we\u2019d break up. That never happened). It\u2019s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.\nSimilar song: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving\nRating: 7/10\n8. She\u2019s a Fast Persuader\nThis. Song. Rocks. My. Socks. Into. Space. I\u2019m getting goosebumps just from writing about it. I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I\u2019m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep\u2019s Clothing, an instrumental that didn\u2019t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass\u2026 eargasmic. It\u2019s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.\nSimilar song: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey\nRating: 10/10\n9. Two Completely Different Things\nJay Kay says it\u2019s from Synkronized, Matt Johnson says it\u2019s from Dynamite. It has elements of both albums but I\u2019d probably side with Matt on this one. It\u2019s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it\u2019d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.\nSimilar song: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized\nRating: 7/10\n10. Goodbye To My Dancer\nAnother title that had me laughing and scratching my head (this time I actually acted on my thoughts, but still didn\u2019t laugh out loud) but I needn\u2019t. For me, it\u2019s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!). It has a African/Latin kind of feel, which could be an overflow from the previous track and it works.\nSimilar song: Can\u2019t think, feel free to help me out here\nRating: 7/10\n11. Never Gonna Be Another\nThis one almost copies the chords from the previous tracks and adds to the melancholy. It\u2019s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it\u2019s a good break up song if you\u2019re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you\u2019re not 14 anymore).\nSimilar song: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving\nRating: 6.5/10\n12. Hey Floyd\nNow this is how you finish an album. Grand, majestic and multi-layered. It\u2019d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who\u2019s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn\u2019t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\nRating: 9/10\nConclusion\nI\u2019ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn\u2019t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n\u201cThat Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.\u201d\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he\u2019s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it\u2019s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I\u2019m digressing from the main point.\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It\u2019s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it\u2019s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They\u2019re behaving more like an indie band, which I don\u2019t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn\u2019t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It\u2019s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it\u2019s going to be a white knuckle ride.\nFinal rating: 8/10\nTagged as:\nmusic Jamiroquai writing \n\nBanana rum cake recipe You rocked my world, you know you did\u2026\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBlogs and hatsFailureWe talk, work, and think different thanks to the WebHayfever and Histamines\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "3 Feb 2022",
        "body": "\n\n3 Feb 2022\nKeep writing anyway\n\nI\u2019ve been poking fun at SEOs that post contextless Google Search Console graphs on LinkedIn to demonstrate their authority and achievement. Congrats, you have pages that are indexable and they\u2019ve been crawled and indexed!\nAnd now I\u2019m about to be a hypocrite and do the same. Well, not quite. I have a reason and ironically, it isn\u2019t SEO related.\nFor me, a major contributing factor in becoming an SEO was blogging. I\u2019ve been doing it for 14 years this year and it has got me to where I am today. But I try to do less SEO in my spare time. I call it LESSEO. It means I still care to use an SEO plugin to deal with metadata, sitemaps, and Schema. But I don\u2019t write optimised content and certainly don\u2019t care about meta title lengths. Why? Because I spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week doing it for clients and any affiliate commission I get from links is so small, I couldn\u2019t even afford a chocolate bar off it (the Milky Bars are not on me).\nBut sometimes I do make an effort. An example is an article I wrote about 10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media. I thought it was a good piece and could rank for whichever term I think I was targeting. But it got little-to-no traffic. But I wrote it properly this time! Eventually, I gave up on doing that again as it took too long and I knew writing with SEO in mind would put me off updating the site altogether. I am only one man with a few hours spare in the evening. It\u2019s quick musings or nothing. Hence, LESSEO.\nAnd then, something strange happened.\nThe article started picking up traffic over two years later. The term driving the most traffic was \u201cfamous hippo characters\u201d. That might have been what I was targeting all those months ago. What the hell happened? Why was there suddenly impressions and clicks? I\u2019ve not looked into any trends but I was surprised. And then I figured I\u2019d change the title to target that term since \u201c10 hippos in cartoons, literature and other media\u201d wasn\u2019t quite right.\nAnd here\u2019s that graph.\n\nImpressive numbers they aren\u2019t and normally, I\u2019d say nothing to write home about. But I\u2019m pretty chuffed because it showed that even though nobody visited it then, they\u2019re visiting it now and that shows two things about blogging and SEO that I\u2019ve learnt over the years:\n\nThis stuff takes time\n\nIt\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 to say \u201cSEO takes time\u201d but people still think if you publish an indexable page, it\u2019ll get indexed straight away, rank highly straight away, and get lots of traffic straight away and that\u2019s never guaranteed. It can be difficult to explain that to clients without beads of sweat dripping onto your keyboard (depending on how challenging your comms are) but it\u2019s true. That\u2019s why you have to have faith in your ability. You\u2019ll know if the content is good enough. Besides, you can\u2019t pin your strategy on one page (sorry, I\u2019m writing that to remind myself, not for anyone else to read).\n\nKeep writing anyway\n\nI could have completely given up on writing anything after the hippo blog didn\u2019t gain traction. Of course, there were numerous factors as to why it didn\u2019t in the first place and I knew that at the time. But if the last 14 years have taught me anything, it\u2019s keep on writing. Even after the seeds of doubt were sown in my mind along the way, I kept going (albeit at a reduced rate). It\u2019s not about whether anyone read it. It\u2019s about the fact that I want to write it and I enjoy doing it. This is all for me. The fact I care less about SEO and still get indexed, still rank, still get visibility, and sometimes get on the first page for a cluster of 10-100 search volume keywords is wild to me, even if I only get a few clicks a month. Those are bonuses. I keep writing anyway.\nSo there\u2019s the context. It won\u2019t win me loads of claps and thumbs up on LinkedIn but it\u2019s cool to me so I\u2019ll give myself a round of applause and a thumbs up in the mirror later.\nTagged as:\nblogging \n\nToday is a special day Introducing RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMy New Obsession Is...

The first is my new musical obsession, Khruangbin. I was put onto them by a Black Milk recommendation. Their new album Con Todo El Mundo is one of the best of the year in my opinion and I found a video of a live gig they did for Pitchfork. A week later and I\u2019ve watched/listened to it 19 times. I am OBSESSED. They\u2019re just incredible musicians and pull from inspirations around the world which has inspired me to look for world music myself. Rather than wax lyrical about them, I\u2019ll drop the video below for you to see what I mean.\nThe second thing I wanted to talk about is Federer. After Nadal\u2019s \u201csupernatural\u201d 11th Roland Garros title win on Sunday, attention lies back with the World #2 Roger Federer as he aims to grab his #1 spot back and retain his Wimbledon title. He\u2019s in Stuttgart for the Mercedes Cup this week and should he reach the final, he\u2019ll be back on top for his 310th week. But I\u2019m worried he won\u2019t emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players \u201cfall back\u201d on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I\u2019m probably being premature as I\u2019ve not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I\u2019m unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he\u2019s 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible. Ultimately, he\u2019s past the moment he should be dominant so I\u2019m trying to be grateful he\u2019s even playing, let alone defending grand slam titles.\nSo, to conclude.

        "pub_date": "17 Dec 2016",
        "body": "\n\n17 Dec 2016\nLast Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend\n\nI\u2019m proud of this essay; it\u2019s the only one of its kind. Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo\u2019s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\nAct 1: Roger Federer\n\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change \u2013 most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many \u2013 and he\u2019s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn\u2019t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer\u2019s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn\u2019t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\nBut 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\nFor me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn\u2019t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I\u2019d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It\u2019s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\nAct 2: J Dilla\n\nMy hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn\u2019t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres \u2013 hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica \u2013 and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\nBy now, I\u2019d discovered he\u2019d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to Donuts, didn\u2019t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\nAct 3: Union and Victory\n\nBut how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla\u2019s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer\u2019s and Murray\u2019s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn\u2019t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn\u2019t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles\u2019 Hard Day\u2019s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\nThe Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. \u201cI knew it\u201d, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad\u2019s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\nReprise\n\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He\u2019s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It\u2019s likely his champion days are over at that level. I\u2019m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don\u2019t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won\u2019t be leaving the sport completely.\nAs for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best \u201cdisciples\u201d is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla\u2019s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I\u2019ve been rinsing out for years, the \u201cnewer\u201d stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.\nTagged as:\nmusic writing J Dilla Roger Federer \n\nThe Problem With Google It If Nobody Listened, Would I Still Make Music?\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nWander in PortoBeyond tired: Part 5My Five Favourite Video Games of All TimeMy Albums of the Year: 2011\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n23 Jan 2021\nMeta-meta-blogging\n\nIs there a word for soul searching but for blogs? Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of that lately because as my output has increased, so have my questions about why I blog at all. It\u2019s nothing new; I\u2019ve asking myself why for nearly a decade. It started out as fun and then fear of no one reading but I carried on regardless because I knew some people were.\nAnd now I know more do but I can\u2019t shake off the feeling despite my continuation. I think I\u2019ve written at least one blog post every month since 2011 and, as I write this, I\u2019ve realised that\u2019s 10 years. This opposes my generally reserved demeanour but perhaps it doesn\u2019t. After all, I\u2019m more talkative in environments I feel comfortable in and a CMS backend is as cosy as they come for me.\nOn my journey, I found this 2018 article from Rohan Maitzen called A Brief Return to Meta-Blogging. I resonated the most with this part:\n\nIf you got into blogging because you wanted to write about what you were reading, read about what other people were reading, and have a bit of discussion in both directions, I think (though my experience may not be representative, as it always depends on particulars) you might not feel things have changed all that much, at least in the spirit of the exercise.\n\nThis was in reference to a change in the blogosphere that happened towards the late 00s, when the popular indie bloggers started getting jobs at corporate publications, they became more money/ad-driven, and the faux-liberalism drifted even further to the right. Suddenly, blogging about your experiences became rhetoric-pushing through the guise of journalism.\nThis, in turn, changed how readers perceived the remaining indie bloggers and their output in a general sense. And the blogosphere shrunk more as time went on. I joined it all in 2008 without knowing any of this (I did my due diligence and read old stuff from the likes of Jason Kottke and did my research so as this is second/third-hand information, I suggest you do the same and don\u2019t take my paraphrasing as gospel - even if my name is Luke!)\nBut back to the present day and the quote. That\u2019s exactly why I blog. I like to write about what I read, read about other people doing the same, and share my thoughts amongst it all. SEO has played a varying part in all that but I think therefore I write. And, yes, the spirit remains because apparently the flame hasn\u2019t died for about 10 years.\nI must admit, I do plug my Patreon in relation to this because all of this does cost me money (and I discussed this last year) but I don\u2019t try to acquire Andrew Sullivan or Laurie Penny levels of income (or try to attain their intellectual level of garbage that garner the money). My means are small in comparison and I feel if people enjoy it, they can pay it forward if that\u2019s a possibility for them. But I don\u2019t blog for money. There\u2019s no money in content, at least not inherently, and certainly not in the kind of stuff I write.\nTime for another quote from the same piece:\n\nI\u2019m not really going anywhere in particular with this: I\u2019m just thinking out loud in public, which is what having a blog lets me do! I also trusted (because it works every time I\u2019m in a blogging slump) that if I actually started writing something, anything, here, things would start to turn around for me, because the process itself is a tonic.\n\nI couldn\u2019t have put it better myself. And so I\u2019ll leave it there. Without a major point. Just another ramble from yours truly.\nRelated\n\nBlogs and hats\nBlogging gratitude\nGet a website\n\nTagged as:\nblogging \n\nSound familiar?

I realised this after seeing the following message:\nThe resource X was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window\u2019s load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate \u2018as\u2019 value and it is preloaded intentionally.\nThat basically means the font loaded but it wasn\u2019t used at all. I tried all the different things that Stack Overflow said but it still wouldn\u2019t work. Long story short: the @font-face declarations I was making in the main theme CSS file weren\u2019t acknowledged so I put them in the WordPress Customizer panel. To do that:\n\nGo to your Admin panel and then go to Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS\nEnter the appropriate @font-face code\n\nI used the following @font-face format:\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'FontName';\n  src: url(PATH) format('woff2');\n  src: url(PATH) format('woff');\n  font-weight: whatever that is;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-display: swap;\n}\nIn terms of the preload code, I recommend the following:\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"PATH\" type=\"font/woff2\" as=\"font\" crossorigin=\"\">\nI\u2019ve gone with woff2 only as it\u2019s widely supported and smaller in file size, which compounds the benefits of preloading for page speed. Just be careful of FOUT and set your Cache-Control headers!\nAnd make sure to put that ahead of the wp_head() in your header.php file so it can preload before the CSS (I believe that\u2019s how it works lol).\n\nMorsel #2: The YouTube Thumbnail Extractor Morsel #4: bulk upload to Internet Archive with waybackpy\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n20 Aug 2023\nMy big Pok\u00e9mon self-project\n\nAfter watching the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships last week, I felt inspired to get all the legendaries from every game up to SV (Scarlet & Violet). Obtaining them has been made a lot easier in recent years, with Dynamax Adventures in Sword & Shield, and Ultra Wormholes in Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon. Those games can take a long time to complete to get there so I figured playing the older games would be a lot quicker.\nThat endeavour meant I\u2019ve played a lot of Pok\u00e9mon and moving them through multiple consoles. This week alone (14th\u201320th August 2023), I\u2019ve done the following:\n\nCompleted Red and caught the Legendary Birds and Mewtwo\nCompleted the first part of Crystal and caught the Legendary Beasts, Lugia, and Ho-Oh\nCompleted Emerald and caught Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, the Regis, Latios, Latias1, Lugia and Ho-Oh2, Deoxys3, and Mew4\n\nIt\u2019s been gruelling but worth it as it meant I could finally finish Emerald for the first time (I only ever played Sapphire) and create teams of Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019d never used before. The most difficult thing to get so far has been the Faraway Island Mew from a Japanese copy of Pok\u00e9mon Emerald. That involved playing through the game (with help from Google Translate), getting to use the ticket, and then trading it to my English copy of Emerald. But it\u2019s there now and ready for the upcoming Get Mew & Mewtwo! Raid in SV.\nAs of 20th August, I\u2019m currently on Pok\u00e9mon Platinum which will give me the following legendaries and mythicals:\n\nGiratina\nUxie\nAzelf\nMesprit\nDialga\nPalkia\nHeatran\nRegigigas\nCresselia\nArticuno\nZapdos\nMoltres\nRegirock\nRegice\nRegisteel\nDarkrai5\nShaymin5\nArceus5\n\nI\u2019ll be updating this through my quest and will likely update my Pok\u00e9mon teams list to document who got me through each game. Wish me luck!\n\n\n\n^\n Using the EON Ticket\n\t\n\n\n^\n Using the MysticTicket\n\n\n^\n Using the AuroraTicket\n\n\n^\n Using the Old Sea Map on a Japanese copy of Emerald\n\t\n\n\n^\n I either won't go for these or I will but won't trade them up to Home as they wouldn't be legal You can't stop me, The Pok\u00e9mon Company!\n\n\nTagged as:\nPok\u00e9mon \n\n\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBOOM!

I\u2019m not much of a gamer either so it wasn\u2019t too difficult to make a list of my five favourites.\nPok\u00e9mon Gold/Silver (GBC, 2000)\nI didn\u2019t think anything could surpass Red/Blue/Yellow and then this came along. I was living in Atlanta when it came out but the buildup was amazing. They had display Gameboy Colors in Target and Walmart and I spent so much time on them. The series introduced some important features that still hold true today: new regions, separation of Special into Special Attack and Special Defence, day and night, breeding, but most importantly, 100 new Pok\u00e9mon. It has since been remade for the DS and will be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on 22nd September.\nChampionship Manager 01/02 (PC, 2001)\nI can\u2019t for the life of me get into Football Manager. 01/02 holds my heart. I play with updates from the real world as not to feel too archaic and it\u2019s the last great game before the change. It\u2019s thin on the ground for realistic features but thanks to some special patches, it\u2019s not so bad. Playing it vanilla and you get some legendary players who couldn\u2019t imitate their \u201cdigital\u201d careers.\nSuper Mario World (SNES, 1990)\nOne of my favourite early childhood memories (see F-Zero and Sonic 2 below). I was lucky enough to play it on a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was the best thing in the world. Riding Yoshi was like nothing I had ever done before.\nF-Zero (SNES, 1990)\nAnother fond childhood game. I only ever played this at my friend\u2019s house as he had a SNES and I wasn\u2019t allowed one. It\u2019s easily my favourite driving game. Incredible soundtrack, super addictive gameplay and then-state of the art graphics.\nSonic 2 (Sega Genesis, 1992)\nChristmas 1993. My cousins got this for their Sega Genesis. I got to play it and enjoyed every moment. I got to know Sonic before Mario (who I\u2019ve played more of in my lifetime). It\u2019s an instant classic and includes good old Myles Prower.\nHonorable mentions: Mario Tennis (N64), Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League (N64), Tetris (GB), Ronaldo V Football (GBC), System Shock 2 (PC), Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes (PC), Super RC Pro-Am (GB)\nTagged as:\ngaming Sonic the Hedgehog lists \n\nI am...

        "pub_date": "1 Feb 2017",
        "body": "\n\n1 Feb 2017\nMy Idea Debt\n\nEarlier this week, I read about a concept called Idea Debt. It\u2019s when you hold onto ideas without actually putting them into place and as they build up, you\u2019re left with an increasing number of unfulfilled concepts. I suffer from this badly. In my late teens, I came up with an idea for a fantasy novel. Ten years later, I still have a \u201cbinder of lore\u201d, along with another of my ideas \u2013 Hyperman, a superhero kept alive by radium gas (yes, that highly volatile, highly toxic gas). While the later was conjured from a bored Sunday afternoon and will never become anything more than a poor drawing, I\u2019d love to make a go of the novel. But it\u2019s not going to happen. I have more high quality ideas from the past few weeks to ignore.\nMy debt continues to build.\nThe posited solution to all this is to work in the moment and that\u2019s what I do. New ideas blossom pretty quickly in my head but soon take over like wild weeds. The negative connotations are on purpose; I become wrapped up and prioritise it over anything else, usually daily necessities like eating and cleaning. This wouldn\u2019t sound so bad except my ideas never go further than my own outlets. For the music I make, I\u2019ve been very lucky to make some money from it and received good feedback from my peers. Other than that, I get nothing other than momentary satisfaction. This adds interest to the Idea Debt but fortunately this is simple interest as it doesn\u2019t hamper my creative desire for the next project.\nAs I sit here thinking of all the ideas I\u2019ve ever had and a debt that won\u2019t go away, I wonder what would happen if I just set them free. Would one of those creative buds be better suited with someone else? I\u2019d like to think so. As a species, we are very clingy to the products of our thoughts. We\u2019re afraid to share them in case of theft and in some cases, I feel we\u2019re right to do so but not always. What use is a brilliant idea if it\u2019s not being used? Holding on tightly to an idea you\u2019re almost certain of leaving in the corner of your mind is just a waste of brain power. Why not pass it onto someone you know and trust? If you really can\u2019t bear to give it away, you have to use it.\nSo that\u2019s what I plan to do. I will outsource the ideas I know I will never finish and be happier for the relief of the burden and know I\u2019ve contributed to the flow of creativity in some way. That will give more time and mental space to carry on with the ideas I do wish to fulfil.\nTagged as:\nme \n\nInspiring Creatives For 2017 My Albums Of The Year List: 2016\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nInspiring Creatives For 2017Night offGet a websiteBeyond tired\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n16 Aug 2018\nMy love of Sony hardware design\n\n\nI\u2019ve not owned many Sony products but I\u2019ve always admired their design. Here are some of my favourites.\nMiniDisc\n\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted a MiniDisc Walkman ever since I saw my cousin with one. Obsolete is an understatement for this technology but still cool.\nSony Xperia phone\n\nI owned the Xperia Z5 but this model isn\u2019t far from it in terms of design. Simple and sleek, just how I like it.\nWalkman\n\n\nI only had the CD Walkman with \u201cshock protection\u201d but the original can\u2019t be beaten. It\u2019s an iconic design and still works wonders if you can find a working model on eBay. Play your cassettes with ease and stay wired for sound.\nPlaystation\n\n\nI never got to own the PSone but I did have the original PlayStation and the PS2. The official controller is a work of ergonomic art and the PSone is wonderful and compact, in its soft grey shell.\nSony \u237a\n\nThe Sony Alpha, or \u237a, looks incredible. I own a Canon but I wouldn\u2019t say no to one of these.\nSony Cyber-shot\n\nAnother example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens. If you saw a digital photo from the 00s, it was probably taken with a Cybershot.\nXperia Tablet\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Zperia tablet I own but the range is great. It\u2019s not my #1 tablet range (that accolade belongs to the Google Nexus tablet  family) but it comes in at a close second with Sony\u2019s trademark polished look.\nMemory Stick Pro Duo\n\nNot quite as obsolete as the MiniDisc but not far off. I don\u2019t know why I like this periphery so much but the typography is great. That\u2019s about it.\nTagged as:\ndesign sony \n\nMy Phone History How To Use Twitter Lists To Reduce Your Following Count\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nTo Be Childlike And Not ChildishRelease Notes #3Feeling Guilty For Pursuing Your PassionsMorsel #9: Oapy\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n7 Jun 2017\nMy New Obsession Is... Sega\n\nI thought I\u2019d revive this series where I talk about my latest obsession. Other obsessions have included Andy Cole and Luke Cage but my latest craze is Sega. I wasn\u2019t fortunate enough to own any Sega consoles until I was in my 20s (or any at all until my teens) but my cousins did. It was the coolest thing in the world to be able to play Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis and, 3 years later, NiGHTS into Dreams on the Sega Saturn. I always wanted a Game Gear but ended up with a Game Boy in 1998, which illustrates the longevity of Nintendo\u2019s consoles and Sega\u2019s downfall. My rare experiences with the Dreamcast didn\u2019t hold the lustre of the Genesis and Saturn, despite being a superior device.\nSega now lives comfortably in the software business and even its mascot has warmed to its new surroundings, fraternising with the old enemy on a multitude of Nintendo games \u2013 you know, that plumber? With the increased popularity of the Raspberry Pi and emulation, it\u2019s never been simpler to play old Sega games without the need to buy the consoles. But my immersion back into this sea of Sega blue has come through their amazing soundtracks. Richard Jacques was responsible for a lot of the brilliant compositions for the mid-to-late 90s Sonic games, including Sonic R which was criticised for its misplaced music for some peculiar reason. My passion for music has resulted in \u201cdigging\u201d for video games samples and what better place to look than Sega and their famous Sound Team. Spotify have a load of their OSTs and I stocked up for inspiration last night. It was amazing, especially reliving the NiGHTS OST which still makes me cry 20 years on.\nTagged as:\nSEGA gaming Sonic the Hedgehog \n\nTo Be Childlike And Not Childish RIP MJ - 8 Years On\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMy love of Sony hardware design24 Hour VirusYou rocked my world, you know you did\u2026Release Notes #10\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n20 Apr 2013\nMy Record Store Day\n\nAs a producer and crate digger, Record Store Day is a like a second Christmas. This year was my second Record Store Day and I was hoping to pick up some of the exclusives. Unfortunately, the main store I usually go to that was stocking the ones I wanted (Sister Ray) had a queue snaking right round the block so I decided against it (I don\u2019t like being crowded). Instead, I popped into Honest Jon\u2019s where I picked up a Sun Ra record and Miles Davis CD. Then, I went to Soho and Reckless Records, where I picked up a couple more records. My final stop was Music & Video Exchange in Notting Hill. By now, I was in my element. I bought another three Miles Davis CDs (including Bitches Brew, finally!) and a whole load of other bargain gems.\nHere\u2019s a full list:\n\nGreg Phillinganes \u2013 Pulse\nRick James - Bustin\u2019 Out of L Seven\nRon Carter \u2013 New York Slick\nMakoto Ozone - Makoto Ozone\nLou Rawls \u2013 Love All Your Blues Away\nWeather Report \u2013 Mysterious Traveller\nRoy Ayers \u2013 You Might Be Surprised\nSun Ra \u2013 Languidity\nThe O\u2019Jays \u2013 Ship Ahoy\nMiles Davis \u2013 The Birth Of The Cool, Bitches Brew, On The Corner, Miles In The Sky\nIlla J \u2013 Yancey Boys\n\nI was stoked to get four Miles CDs (alas no vinyl) and a Dilla related purchase. All in all, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my second ever Record Store Day and I\u2019m glad I went in the morning. Maybe next year I\u2019ll be able to pick up some exclusives.\nTagged as:\nmusic \n\nMy 49 Favourite Albums of 2012 The Colour Of Pi\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nIf Nobody Listened, Would I Still Make Music?ConnectionsMy 49 Favourite Albums of 2012Visionary\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "30 Dec 2017",
        "body": "\n\n30 Dec 2017\nMy Review of 2017\n\nThis was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn\u2019t going to publish anything. My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won\u2019t do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there\u2019s no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that\u2019s a vast improvement on 2016, the Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.\nAccepting My Mental Health Problems and Getting Help\nBeing a mathematician at heart, I like to think of things in analytical terms. Using a scale of 0-10, I\u2019d give this year an average of 3 and a variance of 5. There have been peaks but plenty of troughs and it\u2019s been hell trying to navigate through them. Anyone who follows me on Twitter will have seen my tweets on mental health and some on my own personal life. Despite this, I find it difficult to write about my life in this form. But here we are. People have often remarked at my cool exterior even in moments where others would feel stress. I never used to notice it but now I make sure to maintain this for my own peace of mind. Unfortunately, all that goes out of the window when I enter a stressful situation where I\u2019m tasked with resolving that turmoil. Over the last few years, I have developed anxiety laced with bouts of depression. I\u2019ve had difficulty controlling my anger during arguments and stressful situations, resorting to the foulest of comments for which I\u2019m ashamed. But anger isn\u2019t to blame. I am the sole culprit. Hitting rock bottom leaves you with two choices: stay there for good or find your way back up. I chose the latter. I self referred back to a counselling service and received CBT for the first time. I\u2019d received mixed reviews on its effectiveness but I knew it was the appropriate action for my problems. I didn\u2019t need medications and anything less than CBT (which I got last December) would have been useless. I had a lovely counsellor who listened and gave me the tools I needed and some food for thought: I needed to be more assertive. It\u2019s all a work in progress so I\u2019ll let you know at the end of 2018 how I\u2019ve been doing with that.\nLearning To Be Comfortable Alone After A Breakup\nI started the year with a breakup. It was meant to be The Relationship but it hadn\u2019t been right for a long time. I played my part and I\u2019m still haunted by some of my actions. I\u2019ve reached a comfortable plateau with that after a few torrid months in the middle of the year. But amongst all the mess, I learnt how to be okay on my own. I got my own place (more on that later) and found solace in my own space. I still feel lonely at times but then I remember what certain kinds of company I desired would mean and I came to appreciate the environment I was in. I had time to work on my own projects, make my own meals or order in, go out if/when I wanted to - living my life. It was the first time in my life I\u2019d lived on my own and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything right now. I don\u2019t know what the future holds for my love life. I\u2019ve often segued into relationships or had long stretches being single but yearning for someone but I\u2019ve not had that this time. Who knows what 2018 will bring. Again, I\u2019ll keep you posted.\nGetting My Own Place\nI spent the first seven months of the year living with my sister. The change in environment was helpful and I\u2019m so grateful to my sister for that comfort. But I still needed to find my own place. After 6 viewings, I found something 10 minutes from my sister\u2019s house and I\u2019ve loved the place ever since. It\u2019s a first floor flat in one of the poshest areas in the city but it\u2019s been a dream to live here since I moved. The decor is simple and to my favourite colour scheme: white and grey. It can feel lonely sometimes but it\u2019s my home and welcome relief from work. I\u2019ve laughed to myself more there than I have in years. It\u2019s mine.\nI\u2019m Certified, Baby!\nMy job hunt has been a nightmare. I\u2019ve applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I\u2019d passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we\u2019ll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I\u2019ll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I\u2019ll win the race in 2018.\nI Got A Break\nLisbon. What a city. I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine and the week away was the best time I\u2019ve ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally \u201cbe\u201d. Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I\u2019ve ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That\u2019s my new \u201csoul hub\u201d.\nCould \u201cPandog Media\u201d Be The Answer?\nI\u2019ve been blogging for years and started Sampleface as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started Cultrface. This year, I started LOGiCFACE (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and Playrface. But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that\u2019s where Pandog Media came from. It\u2019s only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It\u2019s often suggested to blog in your free time if you can\u2019t get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I\u2019ve also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I\u2019m tired of that and I want that to change. I don\u2019t know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I\u2019ll take them on instead.\nSo that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.\nTagged as:\nme Sampleface \n\nThe Luke 100 The Last 5 Games of the 2017 Australian Open\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBad Boys For YearsIntroducing RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)Somebody* on life learningHave you heard of codeswitching?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n3 Dec 2017\nMy Week In Lisbon\n\n\nFrom 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon. It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\nThe inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I\u2019ve made in years. When I decided this, I hadn\u2019t considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March\u2019s edition of Monocle. They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation\u2019s virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I\u2019d visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\nMonday - Segunda-feira\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I\u2019d travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents\u2019 house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn\u2019t go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn\u2019t bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn\u2019t realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was \u20ac345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the Estadio Jose Alvalade. The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night\u2019s sleep in months, if not years.\nTuesday - Ter\u00e7a-feira\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn\u2019t included but at \u20ac7 a day, it was great value. I didn\u2019t fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I\u2019d mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I\u2019m back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at Italian Burger & Lobster House. I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\nWednesday - Quarta-feira\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn\u2019t until 7:45pm. I\u2019d picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only \u20ac0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of pasteis de nata for the first time - Lisbon\u2019s delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn\u2019t too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only \u20ac6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I\u2019d only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn\u2019t any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium\u2019s station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I\u2019ve ever had.\nThursday - Quinta-feira\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for \u20ac3) and stayed in my room all day. I\u2019d been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn\u2019t anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn\u2019t regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a b\u00f6rek for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn\u2019t a total waste and I got some new clothes.\nFriday - Sexta-feira\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It\u2019s reminscient of Birmingham\u2019s Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Bel\u00e9m coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called Las Ficheras. Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\nSaturday - S\u00e1bado\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn\u2019t stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Bel\u00e9m for the Museu Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Berardo, a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn\u2019t surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dal\u00ed and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at Este Oeste, a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life.\nSunday - Domingo\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea do Chiado (or MNAC for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya) since entry was only \u20ac4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren\u2019t to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A \u20ac13 buffet wasn\u2019t to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I\u2019ve since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I\u2019d ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for \u20ac4. That\u2019s when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\nMonday - Segunda-feira\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents\u2019 nearest station. Metro rides were \u20ac1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over \u00a35.\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That\u2019s why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I\u2019d been in 5 years. It\u2019s definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I\u2019d love to live in the future. I wasn\u2019t able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.\nTagged as:\nme lisbon architecture \n\nOpen Offices Are Overrated Feeling Guilty For Pursuing Your Passions\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nArtistic InspirationsBlogging as self-expressionMorsel #3: a custom font preload fix in WordPressA note on some notes on writing\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n6 Sep 2021\nNew normal\n\n@clvtno on Twitter wrote a good impromptu thread about the \u2018new normal\u2019 and the fallacy of the term:\n\nThe phrase \u2018new normal\u2019 is one that grinds my gears in a very particular way, because look around\u2026 nothing has fundamentally changed. We\u2019ve had almost 2 years to review our processes and approach to literally everything and what do we have?\nSame old, with a mask on.\n\nIt echoed a lot of sentiments I\u2019ve had in my head, rolling around like an unwanted red sock in a washing machine of white clothes. Something I\u2019ve noticed about this \u2018new normal\u2019 (\ud83e\udd22) from a personal perspective is how my week has completely flipped. It used to consist of working amongst people Monday to Friday, doing the psuedo-extrovert stuff and coming home in the evening. Then I\u2019d chill at the weekend on my jays doing mostly nothing. But now, it\u2019s almost the opposite. I now work from home (subject to slight change), I\u2019m on my own and when I\u2019m done I just close my laptop and\u2026 leave the room. At weekends, however, at least in the last few weeks. I\u2019ve been going out to different places and meeting up with people. I went to Birmingham a couple of weeks ago for teh first time in nearly 2 years, then went again with my son the week after, and this weekend I was at a family gathering. AND I\u2019ve got a long overdue meet up with a friend to see Candyman at a real life cinema. I also plan to see my parents at some point next month and, if I\u2019m lucky, go to Lisbon for my birthday (something I did in 2017 and 2018).\nI\u2019m not one of those YOLO types where I\u2019m making up for lost time by engorging my soul into socialisation. It\u2019s just that things have worked out this way. I still prefer my own company in my own house to relax and do nothing. But the role reversal has been strange and interesting. In some ways, I get a little bit more relaxed alone time by being at home to work for the week. I don\u2019t have to talk to people unless I make a video call. I\u2019m still working but it\u2019s easier. Eventually, things will go back to something resembling what they were pre-pandemic and I\u2019ll adjust again. I just hope it\u2019s not 7 days of socialising. I can only fake my extroversion for so long and I already have 2 years of unpacked pandemic anxiety, depression, and existential crises to sort out without adding a loss of identity to add to it (just kidding, I have that too!!!)\nAnyway, the new normal can suck it and people who\u2019ve learnt nothing and changed nothing during this current-and-still-happening pandemic can suck it too.\nTagged as:\nme COVID-19 \n\nGet a website Beyond tired: Part 5\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nPublic healthMeta-meta-bloggingMy Review of 2017Bad Boys For Years\n\n\n\n\n",

If her saddening accounts of experiencing racism\u2014towards herself and her son\u2014and suicidal thoughts weren\u2019t bad enough, people were exploiting the situation for Twitter coverage. After getting called out (by me and a Black woman), a couple of the tweets I saw were deleted.\nThen there was the shitty \u201cwomen belong in the kitchen\u201d tweet from Burger King which was meant to be a clickbait opener to stating the company\u2019s committment to better gender representation. Not cool. \u201cIronic\u201d sexism is just sexism.\nAnd speaking of questionable mentions of gender representation, I saw more conflations of International Women\u2019s Day and being a woman with being non-binary. They are not the same. You can\u2019t just say \u201cwomen and non-binary people\u201d if non-binary people haven\u2019t called for it and not on a day that isn\u2019t for them.\nUltimately, today has shown a lot of people for the fake allies they are (if they were even allies to begin with).

So I found this and thought it was interesting:\nThings That Are Not In the U.S. Constitution\n\nHave you ever heard someone say, \u201cThat\u2019s unconstitutional!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s my constitutional right!\u201d and wondered if they were right? You might be surprised how often people get it wrong. You might also be surprised how often people get it right. Your best defense against misconception is reading and knowing your Constitution.    \nA lot of people presume a lot of things about the Constitution. Some are true, some are not. This page will detail some of the things that people think are in the Constitution, but are not. \nOne critique of this page is that it is full of nit-picks. Slavery, for example, may not be \u201cin\u201d the original Constitution, but it is in the original Constitution \u2014 the word may not have been there, but the concept was. This is absolutely true. But by studying the words and coming to know them intimately, we gain a better understanding of our history and how some arguments about the Constitution endure.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not up on my American legislature (I neither passed not took the bar) but this appears to be sensible and level-headed but if there are holes in the arguments, then so be it, and in which case email me and let me know. Otherwise, have a read and get educated.\nTagged as:\nUSA \n\nHow much do my blogs cost?

        "pub_date": "10 May 2023",
        "body": "\n\n10 May 2023\nProbably Autistic\n\nMy name is Luke and I\u2019m Probably Autistic.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to write this for months but been afraid of what (neurotypical) people might say. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed of my neurodivergence (ND) but rather the fact that I\u2019m self-diagnosing and people LOVE to say something.\nBut how did I get here? Well, seeing as a professional diagnosis would either involve a 2-year+ wait on the NHS or a 1\u20132 year wait if I went private and cost me about \u00a32,000, I decided to do some online tests. Before you say anything, I know these aren\u2019t any kind of \u201cproof\u201d but they\u2019re good indicators and I did three of them to get a better overview.\nThe scores all came out high.\n\n42 in the AQ test (threshold is 26)\n129 in the RAADS\u2013R test (threshold is 65)\n138 in the CAT-Q test (threshold is 100)\n44 in the RBQ-2A test (threshold is 26; 36 is the average autistic score)\n\n4 tests above the threshold has to count for something, right? I\u2019ll speak to a doctor eventually but my circumstances will be changing soon so I\u2019ll need to register with a new surgery to the one I\u2019m at now. When things are settled, I\u2019ll do that. In the meantime, I\u2019m self-diagnosing.\nIn terms of why I\u2019m saying \u201cprobably\u201d autistic\u2026 it\u2019s because I\u2019d feel more comfortable with an official diagnosis. I know I definitely fall into the neurodivergent category; nothing typical about me on that front! I\u2019m still navigating all of these thoughts and feelings, piecing together years of wondering what was \u201cwrong\u201d with me or why people said certain things about me and whether they were true. But the autistic traits I\u2019ve been reading about have definitely answered some life long questions.\nBesides declaring all this, I also wanted to write out something pointers for people who read this and ever interact with me. Because I\u2019m ND, I don\u2019t engage with people or things in the same way and as I would respect other people\u2019s way of being, I want the same for me. So here\u2019s a list of things (because I love lists, duh!) about me which I\u2019ll update as an when I remember them.\n1. I get overwhelmed easily\nThis is gotten really bad lately. Multi-tasking is not my thing, which means working in an agency across multiple accounts is difficult at times. I try my best to plan things out but I also just want to get things done. Here, I\u2019d say if you ever need something from me, it\u2019s best to ask if I\u2019m available, be super clear on what you want, and when you want it and do it all within the first request. Vague openers usually give me anxiety and I might feel pressure to commit.\n2. I don\u2019t like small talk or \u201cnetworking\u201d\nI\u2019ll do small talk with my mum because it\u2019s safe and easy. I can\u2019t do it with strangers because I have no idea what people really think or feel when talking to me, and I\u2019ve had comments based on my appearance from the get-go (gotta love casual racism). That\u2019s not to say I want deep, meaningful conversations immediately\u2014or ever\u2014but the truth is I get nervous when I have to talk to people. I feel like I waffle and that I\u2019m putting on an act, as if I\u2019m pretending to be a \u201cnormal\u201d human being. I used to be better in like 2019 but it\u2019s gotten worse since the pandemic (understandable trust issues!!!) and my social anxiety is at an all-time high. I have nothing to recommend here. It\u2019s a social \u201cthing\u201d to have icebreakers and group work and small talk and I don\u2019t see that ever stopping, even if there are probably tests showing they don\u2019t work as well. But if you have an opportunity to not do those things and accommodate for ND people, do it. Because that\u2019s the inclusive part of \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d.\n3. My short term memory sucks\nYou know when you go into a room and forget why you\u2019re there? Well, imagine that but it\u2019s pretty much every time you go into a room. I have to sometimes say what I\u2019m there for over and over in my head like a Buddhist chant. I get distracted more than ever before and, while I think I can return my focus to the thing I was meant to do, it doesn\u2019t always happen. I hate it. And I\u2019ve already forgotten what the next part should be while writing this!\n4. I prefer to work alone\nAll the things you\u2019ve ever see me create? 99.9% of it was done alone. I don\u2019t like to rely on people too much as I appreciate we all have lives to live and can\u2019t definitely commit. That means if I know I need something and I can do it myself, I will. And so I work alone and find a way where I can. Working with one other person works for me but whole groups with multiple voices? I\u2019m not good at it and I don\u2019t feel like I should assimilate because \u201cthat\u2019s just how it\u2019s done\u201d. Reject tradition; embrace chaos!\n5. I need detailed explanations\nI\u2019ve had to learn how to read between the lines when people ask me to do things or tell me stuff. But it\u2019s very tiring and I don\u2019t always get what people are trying to say. So I need detailed explanations if you want me to do something for you. Vagueness confuses me or will lead me to try a method that takes more time than I should spend on the task. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean hand-holding but I tend to get flustered if I go down a path and get told that I\u2019m doing it wrong or \u201cwhy are you doing it that way?!\u201d\n6. I hyperfocus a lot\nI love learning, especially if I find something cool. But that can lead to hyperfocusing, which means I\u2019ll hone in on something and spend hours getting into it. Building this website is an example of that. I spent hours over weeks in 2021 putting this site together and learning Astro. Same goes for Neo4j and graph science. And Python. Even Pok\u00e9mon back when I was young (although that\u2019s probably not indicative to autism as it\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon after all lol). Hyperfocusing has lead me to build knowledge in a lot of areas but the downside is creating time sinks where I could be doing literally anything else. Like resting. Less sleep is not good, no matter what people tell you.\n7. Too much noise gives me sensory overload\nI like my peace and quiet a lot of the time. So when I\u2019m in a shopping centre or at work or even at home where my son watches TV at a loud volume and then plays on his Switch at near full volume, it gets too much. It\u2019s why I often have headphones in as a way to regulate the sounds I hear. Sensory overload often turns into irritability so if you catch me in that funk, give me a second.\nSidenote: if you have any comments about this, for yourself, and we know each other, feel free to talk to me. If you have any criticisms, keep them to yourself. If you have any advice, ask me whether I\u2019m open to this first. I don\u2019t like unsolicited advice as it often comes from a different life experience to mine and the rapport is almost never established beforehand so it sounds like someone offering a smile, a biscuit, and a cup of tea for mental health issues. I\u2019ve been accused of being standoffish and aloof many times before when I\u2019ve actually been struggling and nobody thought to check in first. Don\u2019t be that person.\nResources\n\nHow I get shit done (or at least get started) while having executive dysfunction - This is sound advice for any other neurodivergent folks reading this\n\nTagged as:\nme \n\nHow I display my Last.fm top 1000 artists AI should be a last resort\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nWhat are your most used apps?My Albums Of The Year List: 20218 Things I Learnt In My 4th Year As A Professional SEORelease Notes #8\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n22 Feb 2023\nPrompt engineering\n\nI still feel weird about how prompt engineering is promoted as a new concept.\nPrompt engineering is a technique or discipline in AI where the prompt (what you ask a model to do) contains a description of the task you want it to complete. That part is fine and features all the advantages of single/few shot learning. Great. But the rhetoric around it is full of hyperbole.\n\nPrompt Engineering And Why It Matters To The AI Revolution\n\n\nIs \u2018Prompt Engineering\u2019 the Future of AI?\n\n\nPrompt Engineering: The Career of Future\n\n\nThe demise of blogging and rise of the prompt engineer\n\nI think AI and data science have bigger problems to solve than whether prompt engineering is the way to sustain a career. Again, I have nothing against the concept itself, just how people are claiming its potential makes it a surefire hit for individuals and industries. A lot of the time, I see people making educated guesses and turning them into blog posts about \u201ccool prompt engineering tips\u201d. For people who aren\u2019t directly in the field, that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing. If that\u2019s a hot take, call me Luke Warm. Heh.\nA lot of this discourse reminds me of those marketing \u201cexperts\u201d who conduct studies on a handful of websites (1 million out of the 2 billion+ online) and claim that results show what Google uses as ranking factors. The key link is the idea that a governing body of sorts has a black box where all the algorithms live and only the clever few with knowledge in that area can tease answers out of it. Perhaps we\u2019ll see these \u201cgurus\u201d (fwiw, I despite that term and wish people would stop using it unironically) pivot towards prompt engineering to make themselves look relevant and go Super Saiyan Expert 6.\nOr maybe we could fix the models and stop pretending like AI models are magicians hats. Okay, that\u2019s the last analogy I\u2019m using.

There is no social care without basic public health care and we\u2019re being let down time and time again. It\u2019s not a lack of money; we know it exists but it\u2019s spent on policies that specfiically oppose public health care (here and abroad via warfare). It\u2019s not a time constraint because we\u2019ve had decades to do it. And it\u2019s not a technology issue as the other two have combined to facilitate a lot of technology that demeans us and makes us unsafe.\nI don\u2019t care how idealistic the above sounds to you. It\u2019s an ideal we should all strive for and it should be a bare minimum. Everyone should be able to live in safety and happiness knowing that we are cared for by the people around us. But instead, capitalism instills fear in us so we can keep their cogs turning and not even an ongoing pandemic can stop it. In fact, it\u2019s somehow made capitalists dig their heels in and make more profit in the process.\nTagged as:\nlife \n\nBlogging gratitude 32\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nHave you heard of codeswitching?Beyond tired: Part 2New normalMorsel #8: Bandcamp Album Length Calculator\n\n\n\n\n",

I don\u2019t post anything on my grid (in fact, I removed everything a while back) but I browse and post stories. The most common stories I see are infographics related to life and mental health. Some of them are tweets from people who may or may not have good intentions with what they say but, for me at least, I don\u2019t find them helpful at all and they reinforce the reasons why I don\u2019t talk to people.\nSocial media has provided a platform for simultaneous change and stagnation. Thanks to woeful inadequacy in public health care in the West, social media \u201ctherapists\u201d have been the only source of relief for many. That\u2019s an indictment on governments and not those who genuinely try to help. But a lot of what I see skip the compassion that we need to get through difficult situations and goes straight for the jugular. We\u2019re somewhat hampered by 280 characters per tweet without turning thoughts into threads which are equally as oppressive to nuance. But the result is condensing the time and grace to navigate our feelings and emotions and spitting out two sentences that sound sharp and cut deep. That might work for some but it doesn\u2019t jostle me into action. It makes me feel like what I\u2019ve been feeling for years was a waste of time. No time to unpack it, I\u2019ve just got to\u2026 stop doing that thing. Telling me I\u2019m worth it without examining why I never thought I was puts a blanket over the burden without releasing it.\nWe\u2019ve got to dismantle the infographic industrial complex.\n\nRelease Notes #2 Release Notes #4\n\n\n",

How much do we engage with people who search? Do we know their pain points? Why they decide to go to Twitter to ask questions instead of a search engine? Why they might ask someone else to effectively search on their behalf? I know there are videos about \u201chow search works\u201d but is that how THEY see search or is that based more on field research? Do SEOs obfuscate search to retain authority and make profit out of people instead of educating them? Are we constantly following outdated practices because we don\u2019t want to find out we\u2019re behind and need to improve? Are we selling lies and feeding biases because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been done and it doesn\u2019t harm me!\u201c? Just some of the questions that revolve in my head that I have no time to resolve. And then I think about the mis/disinformation around search and how search engines work and instead of those companies looking inward, they go on the defensive. Who is that helping? I don\u2019t expect a masked magician search engineer to start revealing pieces of various search algorithms, presented by Mitch Pileggi. But I\u2019d prefer if the responses weren\u2019t rude and snarky or sanitised to look like there aren\u2019t biases behind the scenes when there are.\n\nRelease Notes #3 Release Notes #5\n\n\n",

There\u2019s a space between the break and returning to routine (if we even do) and it\u2019s such a crucial time. Groups like the cult of positivity and The Church of Latter Day Risers & Grinders say to get back in immediately and to never let a setback or negativity stop you. But that negativity could be a life lesson because there\u2019s no escaping it. How can we learn to protect ourselves or build necessary resilience if we never know what we\u2019re facing. Another problem is not having the time to do it because we\u2019ve got to survive. Many people aren\u2019t. I appreciate that. If anything, that\u2019s where space and grace needs to be given to those people.\nBut you might not get to that point if we live off the short and snappy slogans on Instagram and Twitter.

I remember where I was and what I was doing that evening and for the next few days trying to process it all. One of the most surreal weeks of my life. I'd only become a fan in 2003 after watching this video but it changed my life, no exaggeration:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU\nI've told this story about a million times but I'm gonna tell it again. I was on the floor watching TV in my parents' house. The advert had been on before but I'd not really paid attention but this time I did. Because it was 2003, Michael was past his \"commercial prime\" as it were. Invincible was undersold to his standards and the allegations had ruined him along with his plastic surgery and vitiligo (perceived as skin bleaching to make himself white.) The tabloids had crushed him and he just wasn't the same. My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I'd never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn't until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was \"WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn't human!\" but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn't keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life. From that very moment on, I NEEDED that CD, I needed to see that advert again and I needed everything he made. This was before YouTube existed so I had to wait for the advert to be on TV and eventually it happened and I was awestruck again.\nAfter getting the Number Ones album, I got Dangerous, then HIStory and the obsession continued. I started playing my mum's records when my parents were out. I'd practice the Billie Jean dance routine from my sister's video (this one) to the point where I warped the carpets and they had to be replaced (my parents never found out the real reason why.) I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I'd never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn't believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I'd never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I'd revered and loved so much - gone. It took a few years before I came to terms with it although to some degree, it'll always take me aback.\nThank you, Michael Jackson. You inspired so many with your work and your art in its purest form.\nYour fave could never.\nTagged as:\nmusic michael jackson Black \n\nMy New Obsession Is...

        "body": "\n\n4 Mar 2021\n12 Things I Learnt In My 2nd Year As A Professional SEO\n\nToday marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (read about my first year here).\nHere is what I\u2019ve learnt in my second year as a professional.\nPeople\n1. Women in SEO are still the best\nThis hasn\u2019t changed from last year.\nThe women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn\u2019t have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.\nGet more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.\n2. Experts still aren\u2019t experts\nAnother reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.\nI hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.\n3. You can\u2019t rely on others to make changes in diversity\nThe death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.\nIt left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can\u2019t rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won\u2019t face their internal situations.\nAnd that\u2019s partly why I started my Marketers of Colour project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That\u2019s my sole focus right now.\n4. John Mueller is even more awesome\nJohn, if you\u2019re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\nKeywords\n5. It\u2019s still about topics\nI\u2019ve been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I\u2019ve seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don\u2019t copy your competition, you \u201clisten\u201d to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.\nTechnical\n6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise\nWhen I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I\u2019m more of a \u201cjack of all trades\u201d in SEO (and that\u2019s not a criticism in this game!)\nI hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It\u2019s where I want to be.\n7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.\n2020 being 2020, I didn\u2019t do much with Python besides using the scripts I\u2019d already written. But I need to get back into it\n8. I love Ahrefs\nI wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it\u2019s so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.\n9. I need to finally use a new API for a project\nI still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven\u2019t done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the Pok\u00e9API. Something with natures. I don\u2019t know. Help!\nContent and Links\n10. I want to get better at link building\nI remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the \u201cdark side\u201d aka digital PR and while I\u2019ll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.\nMisc\n11. You shouldn\u2019t \u201clive and breathe marketing\u201d\nWhen you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to \u201clive and breathe\u201d what you do isn\u2019t it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn\u2019t so important that it has to consume your existence.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I\u2019m glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There\u2019ll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing we face.\n12. I love writing for the Small Web\nA few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They\u2019re at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.\nOh, I haven\u2019t explained what they are. Briefly:\n\nCommercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for conversions, landing pages, sales funnels, and ROI.\nSmall Web = the old days of blogging where you wrote about stuff that wasn\u2019t for SEO, posted links with no other content\n\nUnless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won\u2019t rank as highly. It\u2019s that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing too much on SEO. In some cases, I don\u2019t care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I still got traffic.\nWhen people ask me what advice I\u2019d give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say \u201cget a blog\u201d. Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.\nShout outs\nThank you to:\n\nRuth Everett\nRonke Lawal\nRejoice Ojiaku\nSophie Logan\nSurena Chande\nSaffron Shergill\nAzeem Ahmad\nTom Mortimer\nAreej AbuAli\nTatiana Mac\nJamar Ramos\nOlivia-Mae Foong\nLucy Robinson\nNatalie Arney\nPetar Jovetic\nDan Taylor\n\nAnd loads of other people I\u2019ve not mentioned who have made my second year as an SEO a great one.\nTagged as:\nSEO \n\nSustained grief Night off\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nYou rocked my world, you know you did\u20261001 Movies You Must See Before You Die (2008 edition)AI is a lot like an orangeHow To Use Twitter Lists To Reduce Your Following Count\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n12 Aug 2023\nThe SEO of Pok\u00e9mon nicknames\n\nSomething I\u2019ve been doing recently is looking for Pok\u00e9mon nickname ideas. I\u2019ll search \u201cPok\u00e9mon + nickname\u201d and the site I always go to, regardless of rank, is PKMN.NET. They have a section called The Name Rater where people submit their nicknames and the name rater rates them with a healthy dose of snark and cynicism. The kayfabe was real!\nNow, PKMN.NET is an old side and it does remarkably well for these \u201cPok\u00e9mon + nickname\u201d queries. You\u2019ll often find them ranking in second place which is great going but the remarkable part is that the pages aren\u2019t optimised.\nHere\u2019s the metadata for Blastoise\u2019s Name Rater page:\n\nMeta title: Name Raters :: PKMN.NET\nMeta description: PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting\nURL: https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&page=pokemon&id=9\nH1: N/A (in fact, there are no headings on this page)\n\nIf you\u2019re an SEO reading this, you might be having heart palpitations right now and I totally understand if you need to stop reading to get some fresh air and calm your nerves. How could they not have optimised metadata? And that URL! And no headings???\nBut read that meta description again:\n\nPKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting\n\nI don\u2019t know the accuracy of that \u201cone of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites\u201d claim but given its ranking stature, I\u2019d say it has some weight to it. Those nickname submissions also date as far back as 2007. Sites like this would have had a lot of traffic back then and while it might have decreased, they\u2019ll maintain a steady stream today. I did a rough Ahrefs search of over 400 \u201cPok\u00e9mon + nicknames\u201d queries (e.g. fuecoco nicknames) and found average monthly search volumes of up to 900 and total of 29,000. If you\u2019re ranking #2-#10 for something as niche as Pok\u00e9mon nicknames without any optimisation, you\u2019re doing really well.\nOf course, there are plenty of other factors contributing to this and the main one is probably links. Another check on Ahrefs showed:\n\n26,000 ranking keywords for the pkmn.net domain\nOver 45,000 backlinks\n712 referring domains, of which 449 had follow links\nThe domains with the highest DRs were wikihow.com, neocities.org, adblockplus.org, and tvtropes.org\n\nYep, that\u2019ll do it. They\u2019re serving the user what they need (Pok\u00e9mon nicknames), adding something unique (a snarky persona), it\u2019s technically user-generated content, and they have a healthy link profile. And all without targeted metadata and headings.\nSo what\u2019s my point? Well, the reason I\u2019m writing this besides my love of Pok\u00e9mon and my habit of looking at websites from an SEO perspective outside work hours is because of CNET. You might have seen their recent announcement about content pruning to try and improve their search vsibility and traffic. It was polarising and I shared my feelings (before deleting them and resharing with added nuance). I felt that deleting archival content was a bad thing for those looking to the past for context and general discovery. Yes, information about AOL in 1996 isn\u2019t relevant to today\u2019s technology we can\u2019t just delete historical data because it doesn\u2019t suit us in the present. What\u2019s more, CNET are publishing AI-generated content, likely at scale, which will fill the gap and arguably muddy the waters of their site quality.\nGoing back to PKNN.NET, I think their site is an example of keeping something outdated in modern Web/search standards and it paying off in terms of organic performance. I\u2019m sure it could be better but it\u2019s not terrible right now. I can\u2019t be the only one who has visited their site when looking for nicknames and come away with some idea, even if I didn\u2019t take what was there. The site gave me something in an old fashioned way and I think any unoptimised site owners that can do that should think really hard about the ramifications of culling large portions of their site for little-to-no SEO gains, only to then fill the gaps with AI-generated drivel.\nTagged as:\nPok\u00e9mon SEO \n\nAI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nTo Be Childlike And Not ChildishMy Albums of the Year: 2011Link dump #1Public health\n\n\n\n\n",

Automating whole processes I\u2019ve JUST gotten comfortable with isn\u2019t feasible. Adding further complexities like other people\u2019s Google Sheets to my keyword research process will waste time I should be using to research.\nAll their respective works are valid, innovative, helpful, and testament to their dedication. But it\u2019s not for us to dig into the moment we see them or we\u2019ll get lost and not be able to do the work we\u2019re supposed to do. We may never use these scripts or tips because we may never need them. It\u2019s all about what works for you and dipping in if it doesn\u2019t.\nEasier said than done but this \u201clite\u201d version of SEO stoicism (or as I have just christened it for this LinkedIn post \u2018SEOicism\u2019) can reduce the burnout we\u2019re all feeling, in an industry that likes to tell us we\u2019re perennially behind when we aren\u2019t.\nTagged as:\nSEO \n\nThe Numbers Game: Roger Federer Social anxiety\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\n69 simple pleasuresSound familiar?Still ElephantIt's binary time!\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n21 Aug 2022\nSocial anxiety\n\nBy the end of 2019, I was in the best place I\u2019d been in years. I was finally in the career I\u2019d fought to get into for the past 8 years, money was alright, I had a partner and I was happy. And then 2020 did its thing and ran through my life like a wrecking ball. But of all the things that the last couple of years have ruined that upsets me the most, it\u2019s the work on my social anxiety.\nWhen I was a child, I was very outgoing and had little inhibitions. Confidence was sky high (to the point of arrogance sometimes but being precocious is part of childhood, right?) Then high school changed that. I had friendship group but I always felt\u2026 different or \u201coutside\u201d. I was picked on quite a lot in my final year and made a very stupid decision a few years before that for me excluded for a week (I won\u2019t discuss that here). College was my attempt to shrug off my academic prowess for a taste of pseudo-extroversion and it kinda worked for a couple of years, and into uni but then I developed depression. And dropped out.\nAnyway, skip 14 years and in that time, I realised a few things:\n\nThat \u201coutsider\u201d feeling was probably the fact that I was neurodivergent without knowing what the hell that was (recently, I took a few online tests that suggested I had \u201csevere\u201d symptoms for autism and while I won\u2019t go into that in this post, that makes more sense to me than anything in the last few years - although I\u2019m not sure about the word \u201csevere\u201d but I digress)\nI was an introvert and still am (I didn\u2019t discover that until 2012)\nI wasn\u2019t comfortable with who I was and desperately tried to be someone else until the pretence became so exhausting I couldn\u2019t keep it up\n\nAnd only now do I have the self confidence I needed all those years ago. But it feels like it\u2019s come at a cost. I feel more isolated than ever. I don\u2019t feel like I fit in with anyone bar a small group of mostly online friends. Everything about socialising makes me feel uncomfortable, anxious, and skeptical. What do people want from me when I talk to them? Do I need to say lots? Have they judged me already and want me to leave? Do they think I\u2019m weird? Do I make too many weird references? Am I annoying? Do people hate me? Maybe my self confidence isn\u2019t in a good place.\nExcept it kinda is. I know I\u2019m good at what I do, professionally or with my hobbies. I love the music I make, I\u2019m a very good SEO, and I\u2019m funny. But that doesn\u2019t \u201cget me in\u201d with people, so to speak. Have you ever played Subbuteo? There\u2019s a special contraption you use for a player that takes set pieces and that\u2019s all they do. Or perhaps you know the NFL and special teams? Well, I feel like a kicker. I\u2019m called on for a niche requirement and then\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s how I feel, even if it\u2019s not true. But I\u2019d never know if it was real or not because how do you ask for confirmation without sound weird or expecting to get a straight honest answer. And so I live in doubt that anyone I speak to thinks I\u2019m an interesting well-rounded person. I know some people do because they\u2019ve told me and I feel comfortable being myself around them. Others vary. But the important thing is I try hard not to diminish myself (too much). I mean, I hold back my idiosyncrasies when I fear they\u2019ll be weaponised against me based on prior evidence. But otherwise I\u2019m me. And it\u2019s taken years to accept who I was, which is still a work in progress, in spite of growing social anxiety and fear of what someone will say or do because of it.\nI\u2019ve not had anyone \u201ccall me out\u201d yet and I\u2019ll keep toeing that anxiety line like a nervous trapeze artist over a precarious safety net they sewed themselves.\nTagged as:\nme \n\nSEOicism A poem about how search engines can't interpret poems\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nPrompt engineeringRelease Notes #9Give The Drummer Sum: J Dilla\u2019s Influence on the Modern DrummerRelease Notes #8\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "2 Jul 2023",
        "body": "\n\n2 Jul 2023\nSome caveats to SEO and web performance\n\nAs a technical SEO, I am very passionate about web performance. The speed and overall performance of a page can affect how well a search engine crawler can crawl and index a page (amongst many other factors). The usual way to define that is through metrics like Google\u2019s Core Web Vitals, which form part of their Page Experience ranking signal*. But there\u2019s a problem I\u2019ve noticed between both SEO and web performance communities: people are giving too much weight to Core Web Vitals from a ranking perspective.\nNow, I\u2019m going to use an example from Speedcurve to illustrate this. I don\u2019t think the information on their SEO and Web Performance is terrible or incorrect but I feel like some caveats are important to avoid misunderstandings or heated debates between businesses and their in-house SEOs/agencies.\nIn the section titled How much does web performance matter when it comes to SEO?, they say the following:\n\nSince Web Vitals were announced, they\u2019ve shot to the top of many people\u2019s list of things to care about. But Google\u2019s prioritization of page speed in search ranking isn\u2019t new, even for mobile. As far back as 2013, Google announced that pages that load slowly on mobile devices would be penalized in mobile search.\n\nPerformance has had an impact on SEO long before Web Vitals came along. Back in 2011, Smartfurniture.com shared:\n\n\u201cWe discovered we could make a quantum leap in search engine rankings simply by increasing site performance. Across the board, we\u2019ve seen sales increases because of our improved ranking, with 20% more organic traffic being driven to our site and 14% more page views.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Pinterest shared that rebuilding their site with performance in mind resulted in a 15% increase in organic search traffic. (You can find more SEO-related case studies at WPOstats.com.)\n\nPoint 1\nThe first flag for me was regarding Google\u2019s penalisation of slow sites in mobile search. There was an announcement in 2018 in a Google blog post but \u201cpenalised\u201d is a problematic word to use in this context (and many news sites ran with it at the time). The reason for that is because Google has a manual penalty system for serious cases such as black hat tactics such as keyword cloaking, keyword stuffing, private blog networks (or PBNs), and misleading redirects. If you get caught, Google \u201cpenalises\u201d you by dropping your rank or deindexing completely. Most people are aware of these kinds of penalties so using that terminology to describe the effects of having a slow site can give the wrong connotations. So to be clear and diligent, a slow site will not tank your rankings directly. Sites that have issues that don\u2019t allow them to be crawled and indexed correctly will see rankings fall and slow speeds could be associative in those cases but not the primary or sole cause. Hope that makes sense; let me know if not! x\nAn important paragraph from the 2018 blog post is this:\n\nThe \u201cSpeed Update\u201d, as we\u2019re calling it, will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t necessarily sitewide, it only affects a small portion of queries, and a slow page might not see a change in rank because of its content relevance. And that\u2019s how seach should work. The biggest sites in terms of indexed pages and popularity are in the vast minority on the Web. A lot of them are also memory, storage, data, and time hogs. You don\u2019t see them falling down the rankings or out of them completely so perhaps speed isn\u2019t that big a deal compared to other signals like content relevance, link profiles, and efficient crawling and indexation.\nPoint 2\nA few studies were quoted in the referenced Speedcurve paragraph, from Smartfurniture.com and Pinterest. Now, case studies are important to show how changes can have significant impacts\u2014good or bad. But it is so difficult to attribute web performance changes in SEO without taking other factors into account. You often see percentages and monetary figures but rarely what happened to get to those stages. And then there are the confusions between users engaging with SERPs (search engine results pages) and users engaging with the site once they click the SERP listing link. As I mentioned earlier, a slow page may still rank highly so you can\u2019t attribute performance improvements to improved impressions or clicks. Factors like seasonality, competitors, updates, content relevance, and link profiles make a bigger difference on that front. Once you\u2019re on the page, then speed can become a factor. But what happens if you make content changes at the same time? Or change the links on the page? Which one made the most difference? It\u2019s hard to say for sure.\nThat\u2019s not to say I doubt that improving web performance makes a difference to conversions and general organic performance but it requires a methodology and careful analysis to attribute the changes to the right places.\nPoint 3\nThe section titled Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO? examines metrics to look out for when measuring performance and where you can improve. There are four listed:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\nInteraction to Next Paint (INP)\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nLCP, FID, and CLS are currently the Core Web Vitals metrics, while INP will replace FID in March 2024. As Google created these as best measures for web performance (in their eyes, and they know they aren\u2019t perfect), I agree these should be metrics to focus on. But my issue is with the title:\nWhich performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?\nThe question should be:\nWhich performance metrics should you focus on for users?\nOf course, I get that this whole page is about SEO and web performance but users are the common denominator at every stage of the journey. A site can rank #1 for a term and very few people click on the link in the SERPs (thanks, Google Ads!). If they do though, they navigate the site, may convert, may not, may abandon their cart, may not, may leave, may come back, may not. All of that may be because of site speed or visual shifts. Or it could be people being indecisive or wanting to save money. UX plays a crucial part in all of that, which is why Core Web Vitals and web performance shouldn\u2019t be so tightly bound with SEO; it should be connected with UX in a cute Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses-type relationship. Oh, and devs too. They can join in\u2026 I guess!\nMy point\nAgain, I\u2019m not trying to pick on Speedcurve or suggesting they suck or they\u2019re telling lies (I actually like their product and the people I know of that work there as they do really awesome work in the web performance sector so thank you!) My overrarching point is this: when we talk about SEO and web performance, we need to refrain from saying things like \u201cimproving site speed is a ranking factor and doing so will improve your SEO ranking\u201d. Those kinds of statements are either not true or barely true or only giving a small portion of the information needed to be true. The real truth is that Page Experience is just one signal amongst many others and within Page Experience, Core Web Vitals is one part of many. That means it\u2019s not heavily weighted and people (who know that) should be saying it. At the moment, I fear that people thinking there\u2019s an equal weight to content, links, and page speed when that just isn\u2019t the case. Where page speed is heavily weighted is in direct user experiences and people\u2019s abilities to navigate websites in a way that makes them stay, return, and feel comfortable to do both. If it\u2019s a commercial site, they\u2019re more likely to buy stuff or sign up to stuff. If it\u2019s informational, they\u2019re more likely to read and comment. People will always click links on SERPs. They might not always stay on your site for long. Web performance is therefore more important for the latter than the former and SEO, UX, dev work, and higher-ups buy-in should work together to make that all happen and make everyone happy. Or happier at least.\n*Please note: Page Experience is *not* a ranking system and Google has said that before and I don't want to piss Danny Sullivan off any more than he likely seems to be when people misattribute his/Google's official documentation, even if it isn't always _that_ clear but I digress.\nTagged as:\nSEO tech the Internet \n\nPost-It Note directories AI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nRelease Notes #1Beyond tired: Part 2How much do my blogs cost?Prompt engineering\n\n\n\n\n",

Black Lives Matter took priority throughout June and most of July until I suffered social media burnout towards the end, and I\u2019m still feeling the burn today. I log in, check notifications, and log out. I can\u2019t bring myself to read my timeline for longer than about 5 minutes. It makes me anxious, and it\u2019s so noisy but clearing the noise would require unfollowing a lot of people who I like and admire which I don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s not their fault that I can\u2019t handle the nature of tweets, and they\u2019re not even about BLM or racism per se.I\u2019m just sick of the world and things that are happening with no real, sustainable evidence of changing. I felt empowered during the early months of the latest BLM wave (I still don\u2019t know what to call it because it\u2019s a movement that has been going on for years and it\u2019s one of many manifestations of decades of Black civil rights). But then it turned to extreme disappointment when I saw so many people who played at activism for a few days, go back to their ignorant updates or do that liberalist thing where they exclaim shock at how bad White people in power can be as if Black people hadn\u2019t done this for decades\u2014let alone weeks\u2014before.Everything felt like a distraction and while I knew I couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t look to non-Black people for this kind of moral or active support (I say non-Black because a lot of non-Black POCs had shown examples of anti-Blackness alongside White people which wasn\u2019t surprising but it pissed me off nonetheless), it left a bad taste in my mouth. So I logged off and I\u2019ve not felt a great need to come back in the same way I had before. I don\u2019t know whether I will. I almost don\u2019t want to. I want to be able to talk, speak to only the people who talk to me, and leave. Lists serve that purpose but it\u2019s whether I can be bothered to log in to make that work. We\u2019ll see.For now, I\u2019m just blogging. I have a backlog of ideas to blog about and I\u2019ve really got into it this weekend. Over the last week or so, I finally got into Halt and Catch Fire, a series that examined the computing boom of the 80s and the Internet Age of the 90s. The acting was superb and I particularly enjoyed the parts about the Internet, the Web, and search (as that\u2019s my job and a great passion of mine). Then, I listened back to a podcast episode with my favourite blogger, Jason Kottke. I\u2019d temporarily postponed him (not quite a cancellation) after a post that rubbed me up the wrong way but he put me onto Halt and Catch Fire (as he appeared in it for a brief scene) and I\u2019ve modelled my blogging style on his over the last year or so.And now I\u2019m here. Turns out I did know what to talk about after all. As always, please check out the links below to my blogs and Patreon which financially supports them all. Maybe one day I can do this blogging thing full time as if it\u2019s the 00s.Thanks and take care.\u2014Luke\nTagged as:\nracism halt and catch fire \n\nSomebody* on life learning Halt and Make Fire\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nThe Numbers Game: Roger FedererBrief LinkedIn thoughts on AIIt's binary time!BOOM!

        "body": "\n\n13 Aug 2020\nStill Elephant\n\nI\u2019ve been going through Kottke.org\u2019s archives again and found this anecdote:\n\nLet me tell you a story. The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for the Tom Brokaw news program. The reporter had been assigned a theory and was seeking sound bites to support it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat killings like this are influenced by violent movies?\u201d No, I said, I wouldn\u2019t say that. \u201cBut what about \u2018Basketball Diaries\u2019?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine gun?\u201d The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it\u2019s unlikely the Columbine killers saw it.\nThe reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory. \u201cEvents like this,\u201d I said, \u201cif they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn\u2019t have messed with me. I\u2019ll go out in a blaze of glory.\u201d\nIn short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of \u201cexplaining\u201d them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.\n\nThat was from 2004.

Sometimes it amazes me to know intuitively that the grieving are all around us yet we do not see any overt signs about grief that lingers. Like a stain on our clothes, it marks us as flawed, imperfect. To cling to grief, to desire its expression, is to be out of sync with modern life, where the hip do not get bogged down in mourning.\n\nIt reminded me\u2014amongst all the reminders I\u2019ve had since March 2020\u2014that I\u2019ve been in some state of grief every year for at least a decade. Before I used to think they were small and insignificant. Break ups are a natural part of life if you choose to love. Interview rejections are part and parcel of being a member of a capitalist society. Your idols die because everybody will some day. But if you don\u2019t deal with things, they accumulate and I am the product of that accumulation.\nI\u2019ve never felt like I\u2019ve had the \u201cluxury\u201d of grieving when I\u2019ve had to carry on. Some days, you just want to curl in a ball and not leave that spot for days. I guess I have done that before. But the fear of being asked about it by loved ones often pulls me out. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad then. But it becomes grief deferred or sustained grief as bell hooks described it. And because of how society works, the solution is always a book or a chat or a change in diet or a walk. But you\u2019ll read with that grief, chat with that grief, eat with that grief, walk with that grief, and sleep with that grief. And you learn to live with it; to function somehow. I\u2019m still here so I\u2019ve not done too badly but I know I could do so much better.\nTagged as:\nme life \n\nThe meaning of life 12 Things I Learnt In My 2nd Year As A Professional SEO\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMusical InspirationsHow To Use Twitter Lists To Reduce Your Following CountMy Review of 2017What is blackness?\n\n\n\n\n",

It had nothing to do with Sir Alex Ferguson retiring, I\u2019d just grown bored of football in general. I\u2019m now back to caring but my attention lies elsewhere and in multiple places. These are the teams that keep me interested.\nSporting Club de Portugal (NOT Sporting Lisbon)\nMy new official team. I watched them play Olympiakos in the Champions League in November 2017 while I was on holiday and it was an incredibly chilled atmosphere. There was the expected buzz but no nastiness or hostility. And Sporting won! The club is going through a transition period after a number of their star players handed in their resignations, including #1 Rui Patricio, who left for Wolves on a free transfer. Manager Jorge Jesus, who left for the Al-Hilal job, was replaced by Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 and I have no idea how that\u2019s going to go. But we shall see.\nLeicester City\nAs a joke, I proclaimed myself a Leicester City fan when they were coasting in their Football League Championship winning season in 2013/14. I could barely name two players in the team. I got serious in 14/15 when they were close to relegation and pulled off the great escape and managed to name about 5 players. The season after was stuff of legend. Leicester City becoming Premier League champions after kissing the bottom of the league only 18 months before is the stuff of legend and just what the championship needed. I can probably name 11 players now.\nOGC Nice\nThe next few teams hold some form of sentimental value because that\u2019s what football is really about, right? I have been to Nice twice on holiday and it is easily one of my favourite cities in the world. They currently lead Ligue 1 and they\u2019ve managed to turn stagnant water to Italian wine in the form of Mario Balotelli, who has 7 goals in 8 games for the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur side. Fingers crossed they can hold on for the title.\nHoffenheim\nA Championship Manager challenge and subsequent domination of the world lead to my attachment to the German club. It was particularly exciting to watch them beat relegation from the Bundesliga on the last day of the 2012/13 season. They\u2019ve gone from strength to strength since and recently recorded a 1-1 draw with the champions Bayern Munich.\nFiorentina\nThis is a recent following and an excuse to watch Serie A again after a lengthy absence. Like many my age, I miss Football Italia with its goosebump-inducing intro and James Richardson\u2019s gradual loss of hair. More importantly, it was an opportunity for the British masses to experience a top flight league on terrestrial television. Live Italian football on Channel 4 on a Sunday afternoon? * Roast chicken and gravy can wait.\nTagged as:\nfootball \n\n1 Year Later Beyond tired: Part 4\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nThings that AI isn'tMusical InspirationsBeyond tired: Part 4Morsel #1: The Tag Suggester\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n3 Nov 2014\nThe Colour Of Pi\n\nThanks to a professor from San Diego University, we now have the colour of pi and other mathematical constants.\nThere\u2019s so much more to mathematics than those dusty old textbooks from school and the teachers who made lessons as painful as a live autopsies. But not all academics are like this, fortunately. One such professor \u2013 Vadim Ponomarenko \u2013 has taken the liberty of making colours out of mathematical constants such as \u03c0 (pi), you know that symbol you learnt about when you had to work out the area and circumference of a circle. Anyone in the design industry will recognise the conversion part \u2013 changing the decimals into hex numbers and producing the colours \u2013 and through that, we now have \u201cthe colour of pi\u201d. There are also colours for constants such as e (Euler\u2019s number), c (speed of light from E=mc\u00b2), \u03c6 (phi, more commonly known as the Golden Ratio) and more.\nBut perhaps you could extend this idea a bit further. For those who studied maths past age 16, you may know about Euler\u2019s identity, an equation using five of the most fundamental constants in mathematics and \u201ccited as an example of deep mathematical beauty\u201d. It\u2019s as follows:\nei\u03c0 - 1 = 0\nNow, if we look at the result of this equation in hexadecimal, it stays the same and in colouring terms, 0 (or #000000) is black. Does that therefore make the colour of mathematical beauty black? I\u2019d like to think so but maybe I\u2019m clutching at straws and being crude in my summations. But for a colour that is often in a negative light (pardon the pun), both linguistically and socially, I think this would be remarkable. In fact, black isn\u2019t even a colour \u2013 it\u2019s an absence of colour. Mathematical beauty represented as a complete absence of colour and shared with something we often find beautiful when we look up at night \u2013 the cosmos. I better leave the hyperbole here.\nTagged as:\nmathematics \n\nMy Record Store Day My Album of the Year List: 2014\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nToday is a special dayGainsWe talk, work, and think different thanks to the WebStill Elephant\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019ve seen a lot of people progressing and I\u2019ve been still. It\u2019s not been a totally stationary year - I moved into my own place, went on my first solo holiday in 5 years, and got a qualification in digital marketing. But that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m still single (less said about that the better) and despite the qualification, my long term career plans remain as \u201cplans\u201d despite efforts to change it.\nBut I won\u2019t be defeated. My life is to be lived and I won\u2019t stagnate any longer.\nThis is The Luke 100.\nIt\u2019s a list of 100 things I want to do in my life. The idea is based on this awesome post by Jon Westernberg and rather than a \u201cbucket list\u201d, it\u2019s a way to invest in yourself. My list is complete and I\u2019m ready to get to work on it. Everything is split into three categories: things that require skills, time, and things I can do right away. I\u2019ve decided to add an extra category: things that require money (because these are investments after all).\nI\u2019m working on a website for this but in the meantime, you can find the list on Google Sheets. If anyone wants to help out in any way, I\u2019d be more than grateful.\nTagged as:\nme \n\nFeeling Guilty For Pursuing Your Passions My Review of 2017\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMorsel #5: Black fabricMy Albums Of The Year List: 2016What are your most used apps?Beached\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n27 Jan 2021\nThe meaning of life\n\nToday, I had a taxipiphany (an epiphany in a taxi) on my way home from my son\u2019s school. I was reading an article called Better living through self-deception and this paragraph struck me:\n\nThe standard model of the happy, smart, successful human being is someone who knows more, works hard, and has found, or at least is heading toward, their own personal meaning of life.\n\nIf I could make a couple of changes, I\u2019d say knowing enough is better than knowing \u201cmore\u201d and working smarter rather than harder but the key element was reaching your own personal meaning of life.\nPeople spend their lives searching for THE meaning of life when they could be working towards THEIR meaning of life. No two life experiences are identical and it\u2019s up to us to find a purpose, bespoke to us (if we want to. I don\u2019t subscribe to the notion that everyone has a calling, that it\u2019s our destiny, and we should all do that forever). The point is we have the power to do what we want in that regard. It doesn\u2019t matter about aptitudes. A lot of that is rooted in bigotry and hypercapitalist ideals (see Myers-Briggs personality tests and the racist history of IQ).\nWhat is your meaning of life?\nTagged as:\nlife \n\nMeta-meta-blogging Sustained grief\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nRelease Notes #6Morsel #8: Bandcamp Album Length CalculatorNight offBrief LinkedIn thoughts on AI\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n9 Jan 2016\nThe Problem With Google It\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there - we\u2019ve asked a question on social media that would have been better suited on Google. My worst related crime was asking \u201cwho Ayn Rand was\u201d. I received mini ridicule and it was a fair cop. But sometimes the question is asked and we\u2019d rather not trudge our way through Google and its index of links to get an answer. Sometimes the question(s) we ask are quite broad and a simple reply would be succinct and quench the knowledge thirst. And there are times when we just want a conversation.\nMy parents are what you might call \u201ctechnophobes\u201d. My mum panics at the thought of having to retune the television and my dad, despite using Microsoft Office more than me, often asks for help. There was one such occurrence a few days ago when he needed assistance with PowerPoint. I\u2019ve used PowerPoint three times in the past four years so my expertise is somewhat lacking past adding and removing slides. But I always find the answer, or at least try. In this instance, he wanted to do something I had never done before. So what would I do in that situation? Google it. It\u2019s something he could have done, sure, but he\u2019d asked the question and I had no problem helping. And then it hit me. Although the prupose of the call was for help, there was a secondary reason as well - just to talk. Coincidentally, this had fallen on World Mental Health Day and when the realisation hit me, I felt a wave of sadness. I haven\u2019t called my parents nearly enough since I moved out in 2014 and although I\u2019d seen them briefly a couple of weeks ago, this was the first time we\u2019d spoken on the phone for much longer. We\u2019ve not always seen eye to eye over the years but we\u2019ve grown much closer now and he\u2019s been a great mediator whenever I\u2019ve needed help or advice. This was more than a technical support and that\u2019s why \u201cjust Google it\u201d isn\u2019t always appropriate.\nWhen we ask questions, sometimes we\u2019re seeking discourse on the subject. This can enrich all involved with knowledge and interest and, simply, someone to talk to and not feel alone. It\u2019s important not to snub those who are legitimately looking for this. If you feel you can\u2019t have this conversation, direct them to somewhere the information can be found rather than the classic \u201cGoogle it link\u201d. You never know, by answering the question, you could learn something yourself - I know I have.\nTagged as:\nknowledge \n\nMy Album of the Year List: 2014 Last Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nIt's not computer science!Release Notes #14EightWhy do rich people make poor decisions?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n4 Mar 2022\n12 Things I Learnt In My 3rd Year As A Professional SEO\n\nToday marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (read about my first year here and my second year here).\nHere is what I\u2019ve learnt in my third year as a professional.\nPeople\n1. Women in SEO are still the best\nThis still hasn\u2019t changed from last year or the year before.\nI\u2019m especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.\nAnd a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of B-DigitalUK, Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, Crystal Carter, Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.\n2. SEOs really love experts, huh?\nTwo things. 1) I\u2019m honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I\u2019m not an expert. That\u2019s okay to say as it isn\u2019t a binary construct of \u201cOMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\u201d on one end and \u201cI AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER\u201d on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That\u2019s how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).\n3. Many at the top don\u2019t really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do\nI\u2019ll be writing a follow-up to my piece on Being Black in Digital Marketing, looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I\u2019m by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can\u2019t help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we\u2019re back where we were as a community. I\u2019m neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I\u2019ve had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don\u2019t really want diversity in SEO, don\u2019t know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!\n4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level\nJohn, if you\u2019re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\nTechnical\n5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps\nSince my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is AI, particularly machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). I\u2019m not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with AGI or artifical general intelligence and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.\nI\u2019ve also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I\u2019d love that one day. Manifesting!\n6. Python is still amazing and I\u2019m getting back into it.\nI released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct WatSERP script that I will eventually reupload in the future). Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post.\n7. I love Google Search Console\nAfter three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It\u2019s all about that granular data!\n8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!\nSince moving away from IBM Watson for moral reasons, TextRazor has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There\u2019s plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.\nContent and Links\n9. I\u2019m fine with not being good at link building\nLink building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I\u2019ll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!\nMisc\n10. You shouldn\u2019t \u201clive and breathe marketing\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d and \u201cyou must do that\u201d in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don\u2019t if you don\u2019t. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.\n11. Outside of work, I\u2019m a LESSEO\nI will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don\u2019t optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn\u2019t completely unoptimised but not to the point where I\u2019m focusing on ranking.\nI chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate. I\u2019m not Bruce Wayne/Batman to the industry.\n12. I love the Web, SEO as a discipline, and a select few people but I really don\u2019t like the industry.\nI tweeted that just over 2 years ago. I\u2019ve alluded to some of the reasons in this post but there\u2019s a lot of nonsense and noise out there that you have to sift through to get to the things that make sense.\nShout outs\nThank you to:\n\nRuth Everett\nRonke Lawal\nSurena Chande\nSaffron Shergill\nAzeem Ahmad\nAreej AbuAli\nTatiana Mac\nJess Peck\nLauren Roitman\nSophie Gibson\nSophie Darr\nDave Smart\nJamar Ramos\nOlivia-Mae Foong\nLucy Robinson\nNatalie Arney\nPetar Jovetic\nCharlie Norledge\nDan Taylor\nDaniel Liddle\nMarco Giordano\nChloe Ivy Rose\n\nAnd loads of other people I\u2019ve not mentioned who have made my third year as an SEO a great one.\nTagged as:\nSEO \n\nIntroducing RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) You don't have to learn Python to work here but it might help\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nEveryone's a writerEightRelease Notes #1The Luke 100\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n19 Mar 2020\nThis is my content creation flow\n\nA few months ago, I \u201crevealed\u201d my content creation flow (as if it was a secret) and I said I\u2019d write about it in more detail. So here it is.\nTools of the trade\nFor the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I\u2019m prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.\nThe things I use are:\n\nFeedly\nPocket\nRaindrop\nPinboard\nPython\nWordpress/Grav\nBuffer\nTwitter\n\nIn terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use Google Colab Jupyter Notebook as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress and Grav, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay \u00a33/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I\u2019ll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.\nIn total, it costs me about \u00a3140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.\nThe process\nI run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can\u2019t update everything as regularly as I\u2019d like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:\n\nI find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly\nIf it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)\nIf I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)\nIf I don\u2019t want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard\nI use a special Python script to decide what to write about\nI use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site\nI use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don\u2019t write about it, I just put the link on there)\n\nThe Python script\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it\u2019s purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!\nRaindrop has its own API which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my Collections. Here\u2019s the code:\nimport requests\nimport random\n\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE'}\n\nr = requests.get(\n'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens', headers=headers)\n\nresponse = r.json()\n\nraindrop_list = []\n\nfor num in range(0,len(response[\"items\"])):\n\tcount = response[\"items\"][num][\"count\"]\n\ttitle = response[\"items\"][num][\"title\"]\n\ttitle_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))\n\traindrop_list.append(title_count)\n\traindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]\n\nrand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)\nprint(raindrop[rand])\nI\u2019ll explain each line.\nrequests gives me access to the API and random is for the random pick, which I\u2019ll explain in a second.\nI set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.\nraindrop_list is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. ('Food & Drink', 7))\nI create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called count and the title in title.\ntitle_count creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and count.\nEach title_count gets added to raindrop_list and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called raindrop which gets rid of all the empty Collections.\nFinally, I create a random integer between 0 and len(raindrop_list)-1 and use that as the random index of raindrop which gets printed out.\nMake sense? Probably not as that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don\u2019t get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.\nAs for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.\nConclusion\nThis is a flow that works for me and I\u2019m almost certain it won\u2019t work for anyone else. That\u2019s because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don\u2019t have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!\nBut the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you\u2019re done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just\u2026 stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I\u2019m done.\nTagged as:\nthe web blogging \n\nEff COVID-19 1 vs 10,000\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\n24 Hour VirusRelease Notes #11The meaning of lifeBad Boys For Years\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n4 Jun 2017\nTo Be Childlike And Not Childish\n\nIn Issue 104 of Monocle, Josh Fehnert wrote a short piece on adults in airports needing to \u201cact their age.\u201d He observed a man and woman engaging in \u201cinfantile\u201d activities (the woman was playing a loud game on her phone and the man was colouring in a dinosaur in his colouring book - in a suit, no less!). This prompted the following statement from Fehnert:\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the rules of airports that revert some to their school days: put your phone in this box and our laptop in that, stand here, wait there [\u2026] People need to grow up - but so do the retailers that cater to us before lift-off.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to warrant such comments but they\u2019re overzealous in my opinion. No amount of self help books can mask the turmoil of everyday life, particularly after recent events in the US, UK, and everyday across the world. Politicians show a continuous lack of awareness and spread fear amongst their citizens to keep them in control. We\u2019re constantly being told the food we eat causes any number of ailments - from dementia to cancer - and some may well contribute to that and other health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Racism is rife, the gulf between rich and poor continues to grow as well as disparity between genders, disabilities, religions. So when two adults want to engage in activities that bring them momentary joy before their holiday or business meeting or whatever they\u2019re travelling for, should they stop what they\u2019re doing and \u201cgrow up?\u201d No.\nWe all need some downtime and relief from the world around us. Relaxation is fundamental for our mental health. Life is stressful enough as it is. I love the airport but I\u2019ve not always enjoyed the process of getting their, sorting out the bags, checking you\u2019ve got your passport, checking in, baggage drop offm boarding passes, going through customs, taking stuff out of your bags, being searched, all the incessant queueing. Where\u2019s the respite? If a man wants to use a colouring book and a woman play on her phone, just let them. Who are they harming? It\u2019s not business of anyone to be telling someone how to live their lives unless they cause undue pain on others. This does not fall in that category. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, there\u2019s a spacehopper outside with my name on it.\nRelated: A list of my favourite airports\nTagged as:\nlife \n\nLast Name Jazz, First Name Hugh [Playlist] My New Obsession Is...

It meant a lot of me as I was going through a difficult period of my life and Federer is my sporting idol.\n\n\nOn this day in 2019, I got a new job that changed my life forever. I was leaving customer service and entering the world of digital marketing. I don\u2019t exaggerate when I say my 5 years working on the phones nearly destroyed me and after 8 years of trying to get in and failing (I openly admit to \u201cgiving up\u201d a few times), the success was sweeter than ever. I started work as a copywriter two months later and the rest is history.\n\n\nThis date is a date of triumph. The last couple of years have been hell but on those two days in my life, I felt like I\u2019d won the jackpot. I hope I can feel even a small amount of that today.\nRelated articles\n\n/the-last-5-games-of-the-2017-australian-open.md\n/eight.md\n/first-year-professional-seo.md\n/second-year-professional-seo.md\n\nTagged as:\nme \n\nMy Albums Of The Year List: 2021 Keep writing anyway\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nMorsel #9: OapyMy love of Sony hardware designUse Prince's purple for a:visited in your CSSHayfever and Histamines\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n8 Sep 2020\nTrolls and pills\n\nTaken from a 2006 NYT article called How to Be a Curmudgeon on the Internet\nRULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS\nWHEREAS, 95 percent of all the e-mail received by critics and columnists is civil, friendly or respectfully constructive;\nbut WHEREAS, this is the Internet age, and we\u2019re all anonymous and can avoid making eye contact forever;\nand WHEREAS, there\u2019s so much information overload, a little heat and drama on your part may be necessary just to be heard above the din;\nand WHEREAS, many of those who fire off potshots are missing out on some of the best techniques for effective snippiness;\nTHEREFORE let us now post the rules for membership in the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society.\n\n\nUse the strongest language possible. Calling names is always effective, and four-letter words show that you mean business.\n\n\nHaving a violent opinion of something doesn\u2019t require you to actually try it yourself. After all, plenty of people heatedly object to books they haven\u2019t read or movies they haven\u2019t seen. Heck, you can imagine perfectly well if something is any good.\n\n\nIf it\u2019s a positive review that you didn\u2019t like, call the reviewer a \u201cfanboy.\u201d Do not entertain the notion that the product, service, show, movie, book or restaurant might, in fact, be good. Instead, assume that the reviewer has received payment from the reviewee. Work in the word \u201cshill\u201d if possible.\n\n\nIf it\u2019s a negative review, call the reviewer a \u201cbasher\u201d and describe the review as a \u201chatchet job.\u201d Accuse him of being paid off by the reviewee\u2019s rival.\n\n\nIf it\u2019s a mixed review, ignore the passages that balance the argument. Pretend that the entire review is all positive or all negative. Refer to it either as a \u201crave\u201d or a \u201cslam.\u201d\n\n\nIf you find a sentence early in the article that rubs you the wrong way, you are by no means obligated to finish reading. Stop right where you are\u2014express your anger while it\u2019s still good and hot! What are the odds that the writer is going to say anything else relevant to your point later in the piece, anyway?\n\n\nIf the writer responds to your e-mail with evidence that you\u2019re wrong (for example, by citing a paragraph that you overlooked), disappear without responding. This is the anonymous Internet; slipping away without consequence or civility is your privilege.\n\n\nTrolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.\n\n\nDon\u2019t let generalities slip by. Don\u2019t tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience. Ignore conditional words like \u201cgenerally,\u201d \u201cusually\u201d and \u201cmost.\u201d If you read a sentence that says, for example, \u201cThe VisionPhone is among the first consumer videophones,\u201d cite the reviewer\u2019s ignorance and laziness for failing to mention the prototype developed by AT&T for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair. Send copies of your note to the publication\u2019s publisher and, if possible, its advertisers.\n\n\n(14 years later, it\u2019s only got worse.)\nTagged as:\nthe web \n\nProust Questionnaire - 2020 It's binary time!\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nYou rocked my world, you know you did\u2026Musical InspirationsBOOM!

        "body": "\n\n25 Nov 2018\nHow To Use Twitter Lists To Reduce Your Following Count\n\nWhether you use Twitter for work, personal branding, or escapism, who you follow plays an integral part. But the more followers you get, the more you\u2019re likely to follow. The \u201cfollowing:follower\u201d ratio (which I will call F:f from now on) means more than it should to outsiders looking in. If F:f is 1: more than or equal to 1 (more than or equal to 1), you\u2019re not deemed as popular compared to an F:f ratio of 1:less than 1 (less than 1).\nExamples\nFollowing: 1028, Followers: 521; F:f = 1:0.506\nIf this is a brand, likely they started by following loads of accounts. Some followed back. Others are bots/accounts who follow back regardless of who you are. Customers might see this and assume the brand isn\u2019t popular or otherwise chasing it. This is superficial on face value. Content is more important. There are examples where the ratio can flag untoward behaviour. Check out the links below under Resources and further reading.\nFollowing: 231, Followers: 2106; F:f = 1:8.272\nThat\u2019s a big ratio towards followers. Without further investigation, this account and brand/person is popular. They might have bought followers or loads of bots decided to feast on the content carcass on offer. But who has time to check that?\nThere\u2019s a temptation to fixate on the mystical F:f ratio. But you also want to keep abreast of your industry through many accounts. If only there was a way to meet halfway\u2026\nIn fact there is and it uses an age old Twitter feature: lists.\nThe first thing you need to do is make a table of three columns:\n\nThose you follow who follow back\nThose you follow who don\u2019t follow back but whose content holds some merit\nThose you follow only through some kind of \u201cobligation\u201d.\n\nYou can write this down or create a spreadsheet (mmm, spreadsheets!). There\u2019s no official way to export following lists but this is a decent albeit convoluted alternative.\nNow you have some tough decisions to make. Most of us fear unfollowing someone and them returning the favour. You lose a follower and wonder if they\u2019ll be offended. But this is YOUR timeline. If you don\u2019t want them there, they don\u2019t have to be. Of course, you could \u201crelegate\u201d them to their own list but we\u2019ll get to that shortly. Once you\u2019ve compartmentalized everyone, create your lists on Twitter. On a spiritual level, I believe everything we do and experience is based on energy transfer; unfollowing and moving accounts to list follows the same principle. There\u2019s still a connection but it\u2019s a little different. But rather than keep accounts on a list like dusty pig ornaments in a glass cabinet, use them. Lists are basically organised timelines. If you need some inspiration for a certain topic, tap into the relevant list.\nWith a more ordered following list, you can receive more necessary content and more accounts are grouped in lists. And it looks good to people who live and die by the F:f ratio.\nResources and further reading\n\nHow to use Twitter lists\n3 Reasons Your Twitter Follower Ratio Is More Important Than You Know\nSocial networks have trained us to think in follower counts\n23 Seldom-Used Ideas for How to Use Twitter Lists\n\nTagged as:\nTwitter \n\nMy love of Sony hardware design Eight\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nTeams I Look Out For, Post-Man Utd (Updated for 2021)My Albums Of The Year List: 2022My Albums Of The Year List: 2021Release Notes #14\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "27 Apr 2023",
        "body": "\n\n27 Apr 2023\nI tried Vicuna and it made me laugh\n\nTwo weeks ago, I found Vicuna, \u201can open-source chatbot impressing GPT-4 with 90%* ChatGPT quality\u201d. I knew to take that 90% stat with a pinch of salt, regarless of the asterisk, but wanted to try it. (tweet for proof)\nFor my prompt, I tried something I\u2019ve been using on GPT3.5:\nWrite a four-sentence blog post about the hundred dollar bill in the style of [name redacted].\nAnd the output:\nThe hundred dollar bill is a denomination of United States currency. It features a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and an eagle flying over a rocky shore on the reverse. In recent years, the hundred dollar bill has become increasingly popular as a medium of exchange, particularly in the underground economy and in online transactions. Despite its widespread use, the hundred dollar bill remains a symbol of wealth and prestige, and is often associated with luxury and success.\nSounds believable\u2026 but it\u2019s not all true. There isn\u2019t a flying eagle nor a rocky shore on the back. The rest is generic and subjective. It certainly wasn\u2019t in the style of the redacted person I used. But I didn\u2019t expect perfection or 100% truth (and neither should you!)\nNow to test the chatbot element. I then prompted Vicuna to reword the previous output \u201cin the style of Don King\u201d. I wanted something ostentatious and my mind went to Don King as I\u2019ve used boxing related prompts in previous examples. Here\u2019s the result:\nYo, what's good people! Let me tell you about the hundred dollar bill. It's a big deal, ya hear me? This piece of paper with Benny Franklin's mug on it is what's up, Tinseltown! It's got the power to make your dreams come true, or at least get you some fancy threads and a fancy car. But don't get it twisted, this bill is not just for the rich and famous, it's for anyone who's got the hustle and the flow. So if you're looking to make some serious cash, don't sleep on the hundred dollar bill, baby!\nOut. Standing.\nIt\u2019s a very bad caricature of Don King but it made me laugh because it was so bad. I could see a crap (probably white, almost certainly cis male) comedian try this and flop. If there\u2019s one profession I\u2019d like to see put out of business because of AI, it\u2019s that (I jest; AI is still as prone to racist as white male comedians given they both get their \u2018humour\u2019 from Reddit anyway, but I digress).\nMore on Vicuna\nVicuna published a full breakdown of the model, it\u2019s advantages, and disadvantages. The tl;dr: it\u2019s a good open-source alternative but it could never be as good as Bard/any GPT model. Unfortunately, the dataset isn\u2019t available and there are no plans to release it which is a shame and undermines the open-sourceness of it a little, but it might also be a legal thing; I dunno.\nA different test\nI also used it to try and find a link between two randomly selected tags from my blogs. I got \u2018bell hooks\u2019 and \u2018Tony Hawk\u2019 and this is what it said:\nGive me an entity that links bell hooks and Tony Hawk\nIt is not immediately clear what connection, if any, exists between bell hooks and Tony Hawk. bell hooks is an American author, feminist, and social activist, known for her\ncritical race theory and gender studies. She is a professor at the City University of New York and has written many books on topics such as race, gender, and sexuality. Tony\nHawk, on the other hand, is an American professional skateboarder, actor, and television personality, known for his career in skateboarding and his appearances on\ntelevision shows such as \"The Tony Hawk Show\" and \"Proving Ground\". It is not clear how these two individuals would be linked, as their areas of expertise and interests\nseem to be quite different.\nCoherent and fairly true. I wouldn\u2019t have expected an open-source model to find a deeper connection than I would have found besides them both being American.\nI also tried Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and jewelry:\nOne possible entity that links jewelry and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the character April O'Neil, who is a human character in the TMNT franchise and is often depicted wearing jewelry. April is a journalist who becomes the turtles' ally and friend, and she is often shown wearing various types of jewelry, such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. The turtles themselves are also sometimes shown wearing jewelry, such as necklaces or headbands, particularly in the early cartoon series. In addition, there are many pieces of TMNT-themed jewelry that have been created for fans of the franchise, such as rings, pendants, and charm bracelets featuring the turtles and other characters from the series.\nAgain, plausible. The last part in particular inspired me to find this piece of TMNT-themed jewelry which I blogged about. And that\u2019s the beauty of this tech. To paraphrase Joe MacMillan from Halt and Catch Fire, \u201cAI isn\u2019t the thing; it\u2019s the thing that gets you to the thing.\u201d AI can\u2019t give me a finished product but it can certainly help me get there, alongside my ingenuity.\nCaveats\nAs we saw in the very first prompt + output, hallucinations are still a big flaw and it gets bigger with open source models created from better closed-source models. The idea is to take what\u2019s there and refine and pre-train it on high quality training data to perform specific tasks. That\u2019s where this tech excels. Where you\u2019ll find outliers and inconsistent performance is trying to turn this proverbial black box into a Tower of Babel but that isn\u2019t stopping every AI startup from trying.\nI tried another pair of entities to see how they were linked (Martin Luther King and Cuba) and the model\u2019s output said MLK had visited Cuba in 1960. That didn\u2019t happen. These things aren\u2019t great for factual information, even when you hook them up to the internet\u2014you know, that completely factual and never wrong platform of knowledge.\nMore on AI\n\n/prompt-engineering.md\n/ai-is-a-lot-like-an-orange.md\n/future-coca-cola-slogans-ai.md\n/a-poem-about-how-search-engines-cant-interpret-poems.md\n\nTagged as:\nAI \n\nFuture Coca-Cola slogans with GPT-3.5 How I display my Last.fm top 1000 artists\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nIf I were a rich man #1Beyond tiredHayfever and HistaminesInspiring Creatives For 2017\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m currently learning Portuguese and brushing up on Spanish and French on Duolingo and my reading is much better than my speaking. But what if you had impaired sight and needed to use a screen reader. Foreign languages written on English websites are read in English voices as if they were English words. That\u2019s no good to a foreign language speaker. But there is a solution.\nIn HTML, there\u2019s a lang attribute that allows you to set a page\u2019s language and, if you need to, add the language to any number of words or sentences for others. When I wrote this article, I had to write something in Portuguese. I added the following code to the paragraph:\n<span lang=\"pt\">O Sexto</span>\nI then added some style to it with CSS:\n:lang(pt) { \n    font-style: italic;\n\tcolor: #00661a;\n\tborder-bottom: 1px solid #ff0017;\n}```\n\nThe colours were just for fun but it's a great way for those learning the language to be able to differentiate words and practise while those who require screen readers can understand what is written in their mother tongue.\n\nFor more info on the lang attribute, check out a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang\">full explanation on Mozilla's MDN database</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_lang.asp\">CSS :lang() Selector on W3Schools</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang\">how to style them on the W3 website</a>.\nTagged as:\nthe web css \n\nKhruangbin & Federer My Phone History\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nUnusual side effectA note on some notes on writingRelease Notes #3Failure\n\n\n\n\n",

But what about the long-term effects of that burnout?\nIf you burn anything, it leaves a scar or some visual reminder of its harm.\nAnd so I realised perhaps I was jsut\u2026 weather-beaten.\nAfter days, weeks, months, and years of \u201cemotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress\u201d, I had my own emotional, physical, and mental scars. I\u2019ve had to weather a lot of personal storms and those traumas have left me as the person I am today. I still have a lot of work to do and I need help with a lot of it too. How and when I\u2019ll get to those are up to me and that annoying thing called money but I\u2019m aware of them at least in principle. Falling in love has been both a regenerative force and a reminder of those weather-induced scars and how I need to combat them. But these days, the rain does bring me down so much.\nTagged as:\nme life \n\n69 simple pleasures Acceptable volume numbers\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nCherishA note on some notes on writingIf Nobody Listened, Would I Still Make Music?Release Notes #7\n\n\n\n\n",

        "pub_date": "5 Mar 2020",
        "body": "\n\n5 Mar 2020\nWhy do rich people make poor decisions?\n\nkottke.org published an article called \u201cWhy Do Poor People Make Bad Decisions?\u201d, referencing an article by Rutger Bregman about \u201cwhy poor people make low-quality decisions\u201d.\nIf that opening gambit wasn\u2019t bad enough, I forced myself to read the rest. Apparently the reason poor people make bad decisions is because \u201cliving in poverty overwhelms their brains, decreasing cognitive ability by a significant amount\u201d. But it got worse. Two studies were quoted, both taking place in India and the USA (the latter looking at Cherokee families).\nWhat is this classist, ableist, and racist crap? And what about the rich people who make notably poor decisions?\nLet\u2019s look at five of the richest men (in wealth and influence):\n\nJeff Bezos\nMark Zuckerberg\nJack Dorsey\nElon Musk\nBill Gates\n\nThey\u2019ve all made some pretty awful decisions in their time. Especially heinous, you might say. Were they attributed to decreased cognitive ability? No. It was all risk-taking, followed by resilience and admiration for getting back on the horse and trying again. They also had a shitload of money and privilege behind them. Those five men have had the luxury to make bad choices - which have affected people\u2019s lives - and get away with them. Look at Elon Musk calling someone a \u201cpedo guy\u201d, being taken to court for defamation, and getting off. Or Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook as a \u201chot or not\u201d comparison site and then not bothering to fact check political ads? Jack Dorsey allowing fascists to roam free on Twitter while allowing victims face bans for fighting back. Or Jeff Bezos being absolute scum. Etc. Etc.\nThe final paragraph talks about Bregman\u2019s advocacy for a universal basic income (UBI), a 15-hour work-week, and open borders. It comes from his book Utopia for Realists and that\u2019s all well and good but then I saw a quote from the NYT calling Bregman \u201ca more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell\u201d. Yuck. That\u2019s all I need to know. You can keep the book and the ideology. What you can do instead is listen to people of colour who have spoken at length for decades about the struggles their respective people have faced and what needs to be done.\nTagged as:\nmoney \n\nBlogs and hats Use Prince's purple for a:visited in your CSS\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBeyond tired: Part 4Acceptable volume numbersRelease Notes #14Blogging gratitude\n\n\n\n\n",

This list will undoubtedly change over time as I play more of these games and as new games get released. Therefore, these positions won\u2019t stick (except for the top 3; those are laminated.)\nNote: Games with an asterisk are ones I haven\u2019t played or otherwise haven\u2019t completed, which makes ranking them even harder!\n1. Gen II\nGames: Gold/Silver/Crystal\nScore: 9.5/10\nWhy I love it: It built on everything I loved about Gen I and made it such an enjoyable gen. You got to go back to Kanto, which thrilled me as a kid. All the new Pok\u00e9mon were cute and cool and interesting at the time (and arguably still are for the most part). Plus, we\u2019ve since got some new variants and evolutions since then which have made them even cooler.\nI also love Johto as a region. Game Freak really dug deep into the Japanese lore, which I appreciated. Yes, the level scaling after the Elite 4 wasn\u2019t great and the fact that so many gym leaders didn\u2019t use Gen II Pok\u00e9mon was a poor decision but hey, you could still catch them and fight them elsewhere. And I\u2019m sure people wouldn\u2019t have complained too much if Clair didn\u2019t have her Kingdra at the end.\nIf I had one significant gripe, it\u2019d be that grinding is beyond frustrating\u2014especially if you\u2019re doing a Nuzlocke\n2. Gen I\nGames: Red/Green*/Blue/Yellow\nScore: 9/10\nWhy I love it: It\u2019s the gen that started it all. I have some of the fondest memories of playing Blue as a kid and I always go back to it when I need an easy playthrough. A lot of my favourite Pok\u00e9mon are from the first games and while the bugs and glitches aren\u2019t ideal, they give the games a certain charm that were of their time. You can also give them exceptions due to the extreme working conditions that Game Freak made Gen 1 under (and that would continue into the present; looking at you, Gen IX!)\n3. Gen VIII\nGames: Sword/Shield/Legends: Arceus*\nScore: 8.5/10\nWhy I love it:\n4. Gen IV\nGames: Diamond*/Pearl*/Platinum*/HeartGold/SoulSilver\nScore: 8/10 (only for HGSS)\nWhy I love it:\n5. Gen IX\nGames: Scarlet/Violet\nScore: 7.5/10\nWhy I love it:\n6. Gen VI\nGames: X*/Y*/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire\nScore: 7/10\nWhy I love it:\n7. Gen V\nGames: Black/White/Black 2/White 2\nScore: 6.5/10\nWhy I love it: This used to be at the bottom of the list because I really didn\u2019t enjoy Black and White. However, Game Freak did the thing with Black 2/White 2. It felt like a modern JRPG and they went hard with the dragon-mech-dystopia lore in a way I didn\u2019t expect. The cutscenes aren\u2019t too invasive and the bits with the frigate and the Kyurem vs Reshiram/Zekrom are spectactular. That said, I still don\u2019t like BW so that\u2019s why it\u2019s down here.\n8. Gen III\nGames: Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald*/FireRed/LeafGreen\nScore: 6/10\nWhy I love it:\n9. Gen VII\nGames: Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon\nScore: 5/10\nWhy I love it: Placing this at the bottom seems harsh but it\u2019s just that all the other gens appealed to me more. SM/USUM suffered greatly from a bloated storyline with way too many cut scenes that stilted my enjoyment of the games. There were plenty of good Pok\u00e9mon but the poor gameplay outweighed them.\n\nMy favourite Pok\u00e9mon from Scarlet/Violet My favourite Pok\u00e9mon games\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nBad Boys For YearsSound familiar?Last Name Jazz, First Name Hugh [Playlist]My Idea Debt\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n\n14 May 2023\nMy favourite Pok\u00e9mon from Scarlet/Violet\n\nI\u2019m doing this in reverse order but I\u2019ve had this on my to do list for weeks so here we go. I\u2019m a fan of quite a few of the new Pok\u00e9mon from Scarlet and Violet. While these haven\u2019t been the best games in the series, I\u2019ve still enjoyed playing through and catching some of the Paldean Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019ll keep updating this as and when I get round to it.\nGholdengo\n\nType: Steel/Ghost\nWhy I love it: For a start, it looks like the Cheese String mascot which is cool on its own. Lots of nostalgia there. But then it also has a golden surfboard which adds even more cool points. Competitively, it\u2019s a beast with a huge Special Attack stat and that means I can use it to AFK the Ace Tournament (for the most part; it\u2019s not perfect). People hate it for some reason but I love this thing.\nCeruledge\n\nType: Fire/Ghost\nWhy I love it: When they showed this Pok\u00e9mon in the SV trailers, I was HYPED. The colours, the design, the swords. It was my kind of warrior and, even though I\u2019ve used its counterpart in VGC (Armarouge), I love Ceruledge much more. I love that it has Flash Fire as an Ability, that Grass Tera baits it out and prevents it from sleep, and it has access to moves like Bitter Blade, Shadow Sneak, and Solar Blade. If anything, I wish it had Sharpness as a Hidden Ability given its design but we can\u2019t have everything.\nScovillain\n\nType: Grass/Fire\nWhy I love it: I prayed for a Grass/Fire type and envisaged a burning bush Tangela. Instead, I got a walking chili pepper with two heads and I love this damn thing. The typing works really well into the core types.\nPaldean Tauros\n\nType: Normal/Fighting\nWhy I love it: Game Freak kinda revealed a regional Tauros via a NPC\u2019s t-shirt during a trailer and I was excited for the prospect of one (but I took it with a pinch of salt). When it came out, I knew I had to use it in my playthrough. I\u2019d fallen in love with Tauros in Sword/Shield as an alternative Intimidater. It was super fast (base 110 Speed) and was good for proccing Weakness Policies with Bulldoze or Surf (although I haven\u2019t used that yet). It\u2019s a shame the shiny isn\u2019t more distinct.\n\nWeb copy style My favourite Pok\u00e9mon generations\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\nVisionaryI am...Bad Boys For YearsWe are not data points.

It is archived on the Web Archive but just in case the US courts decide to destroy it, I\u2019m putting it here for preservation. In some cases, links have been amended if they were broken or outdated. Copyright \u00a92001-2003 Matt Pfeffer.)\nThis style guide seeks to serve as a resource for anyone writing or editing web copy, and to document some of the conventions that distinguish good writing, as published on the web, from writing published in other media. It is also intended as a complement to this site\u2019s description of the principles of copywriting for the web.\nThis document does not offer a comprehensive guide to usage, nor is it intended as a replacement for such guides as the Chicago Manual of Style or the Associated Press Stylebook. But it is a living document, and with luck it will grow into a useful guide to written communication over the web.\nThe standards set herein are my own, though they owe a debt to other style guides I have seen, and to my experiences using them. Certain conventions (\u201cweb\u201d and \u201cwebsite,\u201d for example) reflect predominant usage online more than any personal preference on my own part, however.\nYou are free to use this style guide for any personal purpose; however, if you wish to excerpt any part of it elsewhere, please include an attribution and link to this site. Thoughts, suggestions and reactions of any nature are welcome.\nNote: This is only a guide. Hopefully, most of its conventions will\nserve you well, but you may find some that you don\u2019t like, or that don\u2019t\nfit your writing style. Different writing styles demand their own particular\nrules, both online and in print. If any of the conventions described here\ndon\u2019t suit your purposes, do not hesitate to adopt your own.\nFirst principles \nIf clarity and economy of expression are prized in print, they are doubly so on the web.\nReaders have short attention spans for web copy, and most designers have a penchant\nfor small text sizes, making text harder to read. And, on many critical\npages on a site, space for text is often at a premium.\nObserving just a few guidelines can go a long way toward ensuring you can be easily understood:\n\nGet to the point. Use short words and phrases, rather than longer ones, and omit unnecessary words.\nKeep it simple. Express one thought at a time, and use plain language.\nDon't use metaphors, figures of speech, technical jargon or other writerly flourishes, unless\nthey help make a point.\nResist using sarcasm and irony; and when you find you can't resist, say so.\nLet your readers know when you are stating your own opinions. When you state a fact,\ntell them where you got it from.\n\nSpecific conventions \nConventions commonly observed when writing and editing web copy are listed below.\nFor terms and conventions not specified here, standard references include\nMerriam-Webster\u2019s 10th Collegiate Dictionary,\nthe Associated Press Stylebook and the\nChicago Manual of Style.\nWithin this style guide, accepted abbreviations indicate abbreviations\nthat should be used on every reference, unless a term needs to be spelled out\nfor sake of clarity. Acceptable abbreviations can be used at your discretion.\nacronyms\nUse all caps for acronyms of two to four letters, except for\nletters that represent prepositions or determiners (a, an, or the).\nFor example, for the Museum of Modern Art, write MoMA. In general,\nuse initial caps for acronyms five letters and longer. For example,\nNasdaq. There is one exception (documented here, so far): WYSIWYG.\nagreement\n\nWords referring to aggregates of individuals are treated like any other word\n(i.e., agreement is determined by whether the word is plural or singular). For example,\nThe San Francisco Giants are going to win the pennant; They are going to win the pennant;\nThe team is going to win the pennant.\n\nCompany names that are written in plural form take singular verbs and pronouns. For example, Cisco Systems is headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Generally, you can distinguish the two cases by introducing the word 'the' in front of the name in question. For example, The Giants are going to win the pennant. Not: *The Cisco Systems are headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Company names generally take the neuter pronoun it. For example, Microsoft restated its earnings.\n\na.m., p.m.\n\nSee dates and times.\nbulleted lists\n\nIntroduce a bulleted list with a colon. For example,\nThere are a number of things to keep in mind when writing a style guide:\n... Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each bulleted item. Bulleted\nitems must be parallel in construction. End bulleted sentences with periods (not semicolons or commas),\nand do not punctuate the end of fragments.\ncapitalization\n\nAvoid unnecessary capitalization. Only capitalize job titles if they precede\nthe title holder's name. For example, Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch.\nDo not use all-caps for company names unless the name is an acronym.\nFor example, IBM, One Touch Systems Inc. (not *ONE TOUCH Systems Inc.).\ncompany names\n\nAvoid unnecessary punctuation and symbols in company names. For example,\nYahoo, CNet, E-Trade Securities, Avanti.\nWhere a company name is spelled with an initial lowercase letter,\ndo not capitalize the name at the beginning of a sentence. For example, eBay.\ndashes\n\nUse em-dashes (either coded as a dash (\u2014) or typed as two hyphens (--))\nto set off distinct thoughts within a sentence. In general,\ntry to rephrase your thoughts to avoid this construction. Where used, treat an em-dash as a word,\nwith a space on either side. For example, No one disputes that Thom \u2014\nwho spells his name with an 'h' \u2014\nis a totally rad dude.\n\ndates and times\n\nLocal conventions for specifying dates vary. To avoid ambiguity,\neither specify a date's month by name or letter abbreviation, or use the international standard\ndate notation, yyyy-mm-dd. For example, Feb. 24, 1998, or 1998-02-24.\n(A summary of the international standard for date and time notation is\nhere.)\nSpecify time of day by either using a 24-hour clock or omitting the seconds\nand using a.m. and p.m. For example, 17:15:23, or 5:15 p.m.\nNoon is 12:00:00 or 12:00 p.m.\nIn general, include the relevant time zone abbreviation when specifying the time of day.\nTime zone abbreviations are capitalized and separated from the time by a space.\nFor example, 10:54 a.m. ET. (This list provides proper abbreviations for time zones.)\n\ndecimals\n\nPlace a 0 before decimals less than 1. For example, 0.27.

In describing billions\n(one billion being equal to one thousand million), use no more than two decimal places.\nUse decimals instead of fractions.\ndollars\n\nAbbreviate with a dollar sign ($) when used to describe an amount.\nSpell out only when discussing the type of currency itself. Do not hyphenate adjectival phrases.\nFor example, A $5 million bonus.\ndot-com\n\nMinimize the usage of this term. Where possible, rephrase using Internet (adj.)\nor Internet company (n.).\nDSL\n\nAccepted abbreviation for digital subscriber line.\ne-commerce\nemail\n\nDo not hyphenate. (Note: While there is little consensus on the spelling of\nemail, it is not hyphenated on most major websites (such as\nYahoo, for example).\nIt is generally hyphenated in other media, however.)\nemoticons\n\nKeep to a minimum. Emoticons can be helpful in indicating\nsarcasm or good humor, but quickly become cloying and distracting.\nextranet\nGIF\n\nAccepted abbreviation for graphics interchange format, a technique for\ncompressing the size of a digital image file.\nhard drive\nhis/her\n\nFollow AP style. Use the third-person masculine form (his, him, he)\nwhen an indefinite antecedent is male or female.

For example,\nGood reporters protect their sources.\nhomepage\nHTML\n\nAccepted abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language.\nhyphens\n\nUse sparingly, and to avoid confusion. For example, a high-net-worth investor;\na highly intuitive solution; a more involved project. Hyphenate complex phrases only to\nprevent ambiguity. For example, some more-involved projects.\nInternet, the Net\nintranet\nirony\n\nAlways give your readers a hint (or some sort of confirmation) that a particular passage is ironic.\nEven the most obvious instances are often misunderstood.\nISDN\n\nAccepted abbreviation for integrated services digital network.\njargon\n\nAvoid technical terms if you can; most can be rephrased into meaningful English.\nIf a term cannot be rephrased, it should be avoided, unless it is commonly used, accepted and understood.\nJava\nJavaScript\nJPEG\n\nAccepted acronym for joint photographic experts group, and for a\ntechnique of compressing color images.\nlog in (v.); log-in (n., adj.)\nlog out (v.); log-out (n., adj.)\nm-commerce\n\nAcceptable abbreviation for mobile e-commerce.\nmeasurements\n\nDo not use \" for inches or ' for feet: For example,\nA 12-inch ruler; A 10-foot pole.\nSpell out the following:\n\ninches\nfeet\nmiles\npages\npounds\nyards\n\nUse the following abbreviations (and don\u2019t spell out when preceded by a numeric value):\n\ncm (centimeter)\ndpi (dots per inch)\nfps (frames per second)\nGB (gigabyte)\nGHz (gigahertz)\nHz (hertz)\nKb (kilobit)\nKbps (kilobits per second)\nKB (kilobyte)\nKBps (kilobytes per second)\nKHz (kilohertz)\nMb (megabit)\nMbps (megabits per second)\nMB (megabyte)\nMBps (megabytes per second)\nMHz (megahertz)\nmm (millimeter)\nmph (miles per hour)\nms (millisecond)\nppm (pages per minute)\n\n\nDo not hyphenate adjectival phrases using measured quantities with abbreviated units of measure.\nFor example, He bought a 1200 dpi printer and a 10 GB hard drive.\n\nDo hyphenate such phrases when the units are not abbreviated.

For example,\nNone of the water was left.\nWhen used to indicate \u201chow many,\u201d none often means\n\u201cnot any,\u201d but is plural. For example,\nHow many companies are going to make a profit? None of them\nare (going to make a profit).\nWhen none is meant to indicate \u201cnot one,\u201d it is singular:\nNone of them is bigger than any other.\nnumbered lists\n\nBullet points are preferred unless the exact order or the exact number\nof items is significant. Numbered lists follow the rules for bulleted lists outlined above.\nnumerals\n\nSpell out numbers zero through nine. Use digits for 10 through 999,999. Above 1 million, spell out million, billion, trillion, etc. (One billion is one thousand million; one trillion is one million million.) For example, The company shipped 1 million units, but only 780,000 arrived intact.\n\nDo not go more than one decimal place when spelling out the magnitude in millions, and two decimal places for billions. For example, $5.1 million. $5,104,300 also is acceptable.\nWhere describing a range, use to, not a dash. For example, There will be 20 to 25 people at the party.\nSpell out all numerals (except for years) that begin sentences.

        "body": "\n\n9 Mar 2022\nYou don't have to learn Python to work here but it might help\n\nPython. It\u2019s a word that either strikes fear into the hearts of SEOs or ignites a fire in their bellies. I can tell you: I\u2019ve felt both. Sometimes, at the same time. For all its wonderful use cases, quirks, and benefits, it is misunderstood. I\u2019m not here to say it\u2019s the greatest programming language (that\u2019s HTML) but I wanted to talk about Python from my experience.\ntl;dr - I\u2019m going to do this in a list format and some of it will be tongue-in-cheek but the summary is: Python is something that you don\u2019t have to learn if you don\u2019t want to in SEO. I can\u2019t stress that enough. This is more of a reassurance than an introduction to Python.\nLet\u2019s go!\n\nWhether you want to be the best SEO (that\u2019s an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don\u2019t need Python in your career. Learning Python is a choice and should be considered with variability.\n1a. You get out of it what you put in but you can get more out than you\u2019d expect. Learning Python\u2019s basic functions can speed up work you may have been doing manually or formulaically in Google Sheets/Excel to the point your computer crashes because you\u2019ve exported a 80,000-row CSV of keywords from Ahrefs\nI started learning Python in October 2019 because I felt extreme FOMO and also inspiration, having seen Ruth Everett do it.\n2a. Ruth, if you\u2019re reading this, thank you for inadvertently doing that. It has changed my life and career for the better!\nIn the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d be able to do those things ever.\nBecause of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn\u2019t understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we\u2019ve all done it so don\u2019t you dare scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches\nEventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to the Python course I\u2019d started.\nI still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don\u2019t but it works so I don\u2019t care (we\u2019ve all done it so don\u2019t you dare scoff!)\nMy background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don\u2019t get on but I tolerate it because I have to. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nIn the SEO community, there are more articles demonstrating intermediate and advanced concepts than there are basics and this is overwhelming for beginners and even intermediate and advanced users.\n8a. Because of this, it puts people off from even starting and fuels the ideology that Python is a fad for nerds who don\u2019t care about content and links and then you get people scoffing at it and demanding we focus on content and links and strategy as if those ideas has ever been ignored in the history of SEO\nIf you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.\nThe script that I wrote about about a week ago took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it\u2019s still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.\n10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don\u2019t neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don\u2019t necessarily have to but if you\u2019re planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.\n10b. Actually, it\u2019s best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.\nIf in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don\u2019t work\nPython courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!\nPython is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything\nDon\u2019t listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it\u2019s slow or it won\u2019t get you a job. They\u2019re not that cute, their hair\u2019s uneven, and they look dusty.\n14a. Also don\u2019t listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you\u2019ll \u201cfall behind\u201d. There are plenty of \u201cexperts\u201d making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn\u2019t recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can\u2019t be \u201cless\u201d. I don\u2019t hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.\nDespite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven\u2019t finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don\u2019t always remember\nAfter a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren\u2019t relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I\u2019d have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it\n16a. Most of what you see probably won\u2019t help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you\u2019ll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it\u2019s unknown to them.\nLearn it if you think it\u2019s cool and interesting and want to see how it works. It\u2019s absolutely cool if you do little things for yourself and move on. That\u2019s not failure and even if it was, at least you succeeded at trying it.\nTo echo the sentiments of Miracle Inameti-Archibong in her recent Women In Tech SEO talk, play with existing code that\u2019s already out there. You don\u2019t have to create new ones.\n18a. From a learning perspective, it might be easier for you to use an existing script, find a fault or improvement, and do that one specific thing. Congrats\u2014you just learnt how to code!\n\nYou can contact me (links are on the homepage) if you ever want to chat about Python, my experiences, how to get started, what I\u2019ve used it for, anything. For us to enjoy and grow, we need love, care, and a sense of community. Everyone should be safe with the decisions they make, whether that means learning Python or not. I can\u2019t guarantee it won\u2019t be overwhelming because I still feel that way sometimes. But there are people around to ask for help (including me) and you\u2019re within your rights to take a deep breath, close your laptop and leave it for a day, week, or month until you\u2019re ready to come back. Or just leave it there. There are no obligations other than the ones you set yourself. It\u2019s good to be disciplined with how you learn as it can build structure to learn and grow but that shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of your peace. Python isn\u2019t that cool!\nI think I\u2019ve lost track of this post. Where was I? Oh, yeah.

        "body": "\n\n31 May 2011\nYou rocked my world, you know you did\u2026\n\nMy relationship with rock music has been\u2026 well, rocky, for lack of a better word. I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn\u2019t an issue; \u201cI\u2019m okay with rock music, I just don\u2019t love it\u201d. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone\u2019s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I\u2019ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What\u2019s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.\nThe first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he\u2019d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.\nI liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn\u2019t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton. There was no real reprieve here other than totally removing myself from the group and the music. The latter came quicker than the former and left me hoping I\u2019d never hear that music again.\nAnd I did a good 4 year run, until this year. Thankfully, no MCR but the rock returned and this time, there was no negative association attached. Why? Because the person that brought it back was my girlfriend. Now, when it comes to music, I can be quite snobbish at times. I tweet about rubbish artists and their lack of talent and regard for decent melodies everyday. But when your girlfriend is involved, you have to really stop and think. And listen. So I had a choice: either continue down the route of disliking anything remotely heavy when it came to rock or accept there was a problem and try and remedy it. The vote was unanimous (well, after a few initial criticisms but she\u2019s so lovely, I couldn\u2019t really continue with them) and I chose to give rock music one last go. I started easy with bands I liked on a basic level: Muse. I already liked Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. I listened to Absolution and quite enjoyed it. As they were one of her favourite bands, that was an easy win. Gave Paramore a go (well one song) and really liked Ignorance. Starting to get better.\nThe bigger test was the Foo Fighters. Now, I felt the same way about them as I did with Muse, ie. they\u2019re alright. Always knew Dave Grohl was cool, so that helped. On my way to London today, I listened through their latest album, Wasting Light. Knowing there\u2019d be some hard stuff on it, I was a little apprehensive. The contemplation of memories flooding back of college and the emo phase. I played through it anyway\u2026 and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. In fact, I was hooked after just 20 seconds. Not one bad track on the whole album (which I will review this week). I don\u2019t have anything to really compare it to (yet), but it really blew me away. I was bobbing my head to the parts that I was worried about. For the first time in my entire life, I was loving a rock album. It was all thanks to my girlfriend, who inadvertently gave me the determination to break the stigma I had attached to the second biggest genre in popular music. I was already hating current pop music (another genre I may have to try and immerse myself in for the same reason) and with rock, I was hating on about 70% of all popular music.\nBut not anymore. I probably should have done this years ago. I would have had more people to relate to and share feelings with on how awesome the albums were, but it\u2019s better late than never. Rock needn\u2019t be about people moshing or thrashing about on guitars making nothing but discordant noise \u2013 that\u2019s what death and speed metal are for (controversial). I\u2019m pleased to have embraced a genre that I had ignored for many years and I\u2019m looking forward to discovering new bands and albums, not only from rock but its other sub-genres and other genres I\u2019ve been sleeping on. Now, if I can just return the favour and get her to like hip hop\u2026\nTagged as:\nmusic writing \n\nReview: Jamiroquai \u2013 Rock Dust Light Star Ceci n\u2019est pas une blog\n\nRandom posts you might be interested in:\n\n1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die (2008 edition)Release Notes #9Get a websiteThe Exclusive Website\n\n\n\n\n",
