It is also intended as a complement to this site's description of the principles of \u003Ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220709170602/http://www.provenanceunknown.com/edit/basics.html\">copywriting for the web\u003C/a>.\n\nThis document does not offer a comprehensive guide to usage, nor is it intended as a replacement for such guides as the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chicago-Manual-Style-Univ/dp/022628705X?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&inkId=ae0a61b81e6f4877f5afc51eeda3b05f&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Chicago Manual of Style\u003C/a> or the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Associated-Press-Stylebook-2022-2024-ebook/dp/B0B72HTS37?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&linkId=fae8770c1306762a8e4be7cd6f59b5b7&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Associated Press Stylebook\u003C/a>. But it is a living document, and with luck it will grow into a useful guide to written communication over the web.\n\nThe standards set herein are my own, though they owe a debt to other style guides I have seen, and to my experiences using them. Certain conventions (\"web\" and \"website,\" for example) reflect predominant usage online more than any personal preference on my own part, however.\n\nYou are free to use this style guide for any personal purpose; however, if you wish to excerpt any part of it elsewhere, please include an attribution and link to this site. Thoughts, suggestions and reactions of any nature \u003Ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220127234244/http://www.provenanceunknown.com/about/contact.html\">are welcome\u003C/a>.\n\n\u003Cb>Note:\u003C/b> This is only a guide. Hopefully, most of its conventions will\nserve you well, but you may find some that you don't like, or that don't\nfit your writing style. Different writing styles demand their own particular\nrules, both online and in print. If any of the conventions described here\ndon't suit your purposes, do not hesitate to adopt your own.\n\n\u003Ch2>First principles \u003C/h2>\n\nIf clarity and economy of expression are prized in print, they are doubly so on the web.\nReaders have short attention spans for web copy, and most designers have a penchant\nfor small text sizes, making text harder to read. And, on many critical\npages on a site, space for text is often at a premium.\n\nObserving just a few guidelines can go a long way toward ensuring you can be easily understood:\n\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Get to the point. Use short words and phrases, rather than longer ones, and omit unnecessary words.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Keep it simple. Express one thought at a time, and use plain language.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don't use metaphors, figures of speech, technical jargon or other writerly flourishes, unless\nthey help make a point.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Resist using sarcasm and irony; and when you find you can't resist, say so.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Let your readers know when you are stating your own opinions. When you state a fact,\ntell them where you got it from.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n\u003Ch2>Specific conventions \u003C/h2>\n\nConventions commonly observed when writing and editing web copy are listed below.\nFor terms and conventions not specified here, standard references include\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/\">Merriam-Webster's 10th Collegiate Dictionary\u003C/a>,\nthe Associated Press Stylebook and the\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\">Chicago Manual of Style\u003C/a>.\n\nWithin this style guide, accepted abbreviations indicate abbreviations\nthat should be used on every reference, unless a term needs to be spelled out\nfor sake of clarity. Acceptable abbreviations can be used at your discretion.\n\n\u003Cb>acronyms\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>Use all caps for acronyms of two to four letters, except for\nletters that represent prepositions or determiners (a, an, or the).\nFor example, for the Museum of Modern Art, write MoMA. In general,\nuse initial caps for acronyms five letters and longer. For example,\nNasdaq. There is one exception (documented here, so far): WYSIWYG.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>agreement\u003C/b>\n> Words referring to aggregates of individuals are treated like any other word\n(i.e., agreement is determined by whether the word is plural or singular). For example,\nThe San Francisco Giants are going to win the pennant; They are going to win the pennant;\nThe team is going to win the pennant.\n\u003Cbr>\n> Company names that are written in plural form take singular verbs and pronouns. For example, Cisco Systems is headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Generally, you can distinguish the two cases by introducing the word 'the' in front of the name in question. For example, The Giants are going to win the pennant. Not: *The Cisco Systems are headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Company names generally take the neuter pronoun it. For example, Microsoft restated its earnings.\n\n\u003Cb>a.m., p.m.\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nSee \u003Ca href=\"#datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/a>.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>bulleted lists\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nIntroduce a bulleted list with a colon. For example,\nThere are a number of things to keep in mind when writing a style guide:\n... Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each bulleted item. Bulleted\nitems must be parallel in construction. End bulleted sentences with periods (not semicolons or commas),\nand do not punctuate the end of fragments.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>capitalization\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary capitalization. Only capitalize job titles if they precede\nthe title holder's name. For example, Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch.\nDo not use all-caps for company names unless the name is an acronym.\nFor example, IBM, One Touch Systems Inc. (not *ONE TOUCH Systems Inc.).\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>company names\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary punctuation and symbols in company names. For example,\nYahoo, CNet, E-Trade Securities, Avanti.\n\nWhere a company name is spelled with an initial lowercase letter,\ndo not capitalize the name at the beginning of a sentence. For example, eBay.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>dashes\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nUse em-dashes (either coded as a dash (—) or typed as two hyphens (--))\nto set off distinct thoughts within a sentence. In general,\ntry to rephrase your thoughts to avoid this construction. Where used, treat an em-dash as a word,\nwith a space on either side. For example, No one disputes that Thom —\nwho spells his name with an 'h' —\nis a totally rad dude.\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb id=\"datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nLocal conventions for specifying dates vary. To avoid ambiguity,\neither specify a date's month by name or letter abbreviation, or use the international standard\ndate notation, yyyy-mm-dd. For example, Feb. 24, 1998, or 1998-02-24.\n(A summary of the international standard for date and time notation is\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html\" title=\"A Summary of the International Standard Date and Time Notation\">here\u003C/a>.)\n\nSpecify time of day by either using a 24-hour clock or omitting the seconds\nand using a.m. and p.m. For example, 17:15:23, or 5:15 p.m.\nNoon is 12:00:00 or 12:00 p.m.\n\n\nIn general, include the relevant time zone abbreviation when specifying the time of day.\nTime zone abbreviations are capitalized and separated from the time by a space.\nFor example, 10:54 a.m. ET. (\u003Ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030801073443/http://www.timeanddate.com:80/time/abbreviations.html\" title=\"Time Zone Abbreviations\">This list\u003C/a> provides proper abbreviations for time zones.)\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>decimals\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nPlace a 0 before decimals less than 1. For example, 0.27. In describing quantities\nin millions, use one decimal place at most. For example, $2.7 million. In describing billions\n(one billion being equal to one thousand million), use no more than two decimal places.\n\nUse decimals instead of fractions.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>dollars\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAbbreviate with a dollar sign ($) when used to describe an amount.\nSpell out only when discussing the type of currency itself. Do not hyphenate adjectival phrases.\nFor example, A $5 million bonus.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>dot-com\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nMinimize the usage of this term. Where possible, rephrase using Internet (adj.)\nor Internet company (n.).\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>DSL\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAccepted abbreviation for digital subscriber line.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>e-commerce\u003C/b>\n\n\u003Cb>email\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nDo not hyphenate. (Note: While there is little consensus on the spelling of\nemail, it is not hyphenated on most major websites (such as\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo\u003C/a>, for example).\nIt is generally hyphenated in other media, however.)\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>emoticons\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nKeep to a minimum. Emoticons can be helpful in indicating\nsarcasm or good humor, but quickly become cloying and distracting.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>extranet\u003C/b>\n\n\u003Cb>GIF\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAccepted abbreviation for graphics interchange format, a technique for\ncompressing the size of a digital image file.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>hard drive\u003C/b>\n\n\u003Cb>his/her\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nFollow AP style. Use the third-person masculine form (his, him, he)\nwhen an indefinite antecedent is male or female. For example, A good reporter protects his sources.\nIt is preferable, however, to rephrase a sentence to avoid this construction.

Use short words and phrases, rather than longer ones, and omit unnecessary words.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Keep it simple. Express one thought at a time, and use plain language.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don't use metaphors, figures of speech, technical jargon or other writerly flourishes, unless\nthey help make a point.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Resist using sarcasm and irony; and when you find you can't resist, say so.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Let your readers know when you are stating your own opinions. When you state a fact,\ntell them where you got it from.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Specific conventions \u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Conventions commonly observed when writing and editing web copy are listed below.\nFor terms and conventions not specified here, standard references include\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/\">Merriam-Webster’s 10th Collegiate Dictionary\u003C/a>,\nthe Associated Press Stylebook and the\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\">Chicago Manual of Style\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within this style guide, accepted abbreviations indicate abbreviations\nthat should be used on every reference, unless a term needs to be spelled out\nfor sake of clarity. Acceptable abbreviations can be used at your discretion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>acronyms\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>Use all caps for acronyms of two to four letters, except for\nletters that represent prepositions or determiners (a, an, or the).\nFor example, for the Museum of Modern Art, write MoMA. In general,\nuse initial caps for acronyms five letters and longer. For example,\nNasdaq. There is one exception (documented here, so far): WYSIWYG.\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>agreement\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Words referring to aggregates of individuals are treated like any other word\n(i.e., agreement is determined by whether the word is plural or singular). For example,\nThe San Francisco Giants are going to win the pennant; They are going to win the pennant;\nThe team is going to win the pennant.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cbr>\nCompany names that are written in plural form take singular verbs and pronouns. For example, Cisco Systems is headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Generally, you can distinguish the two cases by introducing the word 'the' in front of the name in question. For example, The Giants are going to win the pennant. Not: *The Cisco Systems are headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Company names generally take the neuter pronoun it. For example, Microsoft restated its earnings.\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>a.m., p.m.\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nSee \u003Ca href=\"#datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/a>.\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>bulleted lists\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nIntroduce a bulleted list with a colon. For example,\nThere are a number of things to keep in mind when writing a style guide:\n... Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each bulleted item. Bulleted\nitems must be parallel in construction. End bulleted sentences with periods (not semicolons or commas),\nand do not punctuate the end of fragments.\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>capitalization\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary capitalization. Only capitalize job titles if they precede\nthe title holder's name. For example, Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch.\nDo not use all-caps for company names unless the name is an acronym.\nFor example, IBM, One Touch Systems Inc. (not *ONE TOUCH Systems Inc.).\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>company names\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary punctuation and symbols in company names. For example,\nYahoo, CNet, E-Trade Securities, Avanti.\n\u003Cp>Where a company name is spelled with an initial lowercase letter,\ndo not capitalize the name at the beginning of a sentence. For example, eBay.\u003C/p>\u003C/blockquote>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb>dashes\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nUse em-dashes (either coded as a dash (—) or typed as two hyphens (--))\nto set off distinct thoughts within a sentence. In general,\ntry to rephrase your thoughts to avoid this construction. Where used, treat an em-dash as a word,\nwith a space on either side. For example, No one disputes that Thom —\nwho spells his name with an 'h' —\nis a totally rad dude.\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cb id=\"datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/b>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nLocal conventions for specifying dates vary. To avoid ambiguity,\neither specify a date's month by name or letter abbreviation, or use the international standard\ndate notation, yyyy-mm-dd. For example, Feb. 24, 1998, or 1998-02-24.\n(A summary of the international standard for date and time notation is\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html\" title=\"A Summary of the International Standard Date and Time Notation\">here\u003C/a>.)\n\u003Cp>Specify time of day by either using a 24-hour clock or omitting the seconds\nand using a.m. and p.m. For example, 17:15:23, or 5:15 p.m.\nNoon is 12:00:00 or 12:00 p.m.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In general, include the relevant time zone abbreviation when specifying the time of day.\nTime zone abbreviations are capitalized and separated from the time by a space.\nFor example, 10:54 a.m. ET.

It was directed by Albert Pyun and stars a cyborg trying to free himself from the life as a cop and the police demanding he do one last job. It's chaotic, a mess, and absolutely fantastic. At first, I was like \"okay, this isn't too bad\" and then there were two scenes that elevated my enjoyment. One involved an old woman getting harassed by a robot, only for her to pull out a gun from her bag and shooting it to death. Damn, granny! Then there was a fight scene with the main character sliding down a muddy chute and fending off a robot and it was incredible. I'm very tempted to watch it all again. The plot itself is lacking and the dialogue is objectively awful but that all adds to the film's charm and I don't think Pyun was trying to make an Oscar winner here. Instead, he won my heart.\n\nIn contrast, my least favourite was another Pyun movie called Postmortem. It started Charlie Sheen in the lead role and it just felt like a feature length episode of Taggart (IYKYK), both for the subject matter and the fact it was set in Glasgow (it was originally meant to be set in San Francisco; talk about a switch up!)\n\nI also watched Animalympics for the first time in about 25 years and that was really cool and funny. I still knew the words to the songs (thanks, brain!)\n\n## Games\n\n### Pokémon Platinum\n\nI started my playthrough a few months ago and I finally finished it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted. It cemented my opinion that the original Sinnoh games were vastly overrated and I wish Gen 8 hadn't been dominated by them so much.\n\n### Pokémon White\n\nAfter finishing Platinum, I had the choice of BW or XY. In the end, I chose White despite having completed Black and Black 2 already this year but I needed to give the generation one last chance to see if the first games were really that bad. The difference here is that I'm playing White on an emulator and the graphics are so much better. I might actually enjoy the game this time!\n\n## Videos\n\n### yr fave film critic\n\nMy friend Dom has a podcast series called [yr fave film critic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G) where he talks about film news, what he's watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It's so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)\n\n### Law & Order clips\n\nI watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said \"here, have some more\" and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn't conducive to good mental health. But the clips were good!\n\n## Music\n\n### Robert Palmer\n\nNowhere near as much as the weeks before but I still listened to Addicted to Love, I Didn't Mean To Turn You On, and You Are In My System amongst others\n\n### Corinne Bailey Rae\n\nAnother amazing artist from West Yorkshire, Corinne Bailey Rae's new album Black Rainbows is amazing. It has some rock, some punk, R&B, electronica, classical, all of it. And her voice sounds sublime. Amazing range, you should definitely check it out.\n\n**Other music you should check out**:\n\n* Eddie Chacon - Sundown\n* Quantic - Dancing While Falling\n* Halibab Matador - Souvenirs\n* thxk_u - B.O.B\n* earfluvv & aroma - Sonic Oddities\n\n## Books\n\nNo books again this week.

Julia Roberts's voice was so relaxing as Charlotte and Steve Buscemi played a great rat as Templeton.\n\nI revisited the Happy Death Day series for the first time in a while and had a bit of a 90s film bonanza for the rest of the month, starting with Street Fighter (RIP \u003Cspan lang=\"es-PR\">Raúl Juliá\u003C/span>), doing the original Mortal Kombat double for the first time, revisiting Nemesis and Heat, and finally ending with My Life, a poignant movie about life and how we can craft it through a series of misunderstandings but change them at any given moment.\n\n## Games\n\n### Dragon Quest VIII\n\nI wanted to try a DQ game that didn't tie me to the PS4 but also wasn't one of the 16-bit games, and since VIII is so highly regarded, I went for that. I initially tried this on PS2 but the frame rate was so bad on the emulator (even on a Pixel 5), that I went for the 3DS version and it's been great with the voice acting and the mechanics. Again, I don't mind the grind as much especially with speed up and it's not like Pokémon where you don't necessarily need strategy (compared to VGC).\n\n### Dragon Quest XI S\n\nSeeing how good this looked on PS4, I decided to get a PS4 Pro just so I could play it. Yes, it was already on Switch but I don't regret the decision but it looks and plays amazingly and it's a game I'm co-oping with my son which adds a unique element to it all. The voice acting is stellar, I actually enjoy the cut scenes for once, and it's just a gorgeous game so far.\n\n### Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince\n\nI picked this up as a promotion treat and I've loved it so far. It has all the charm of the previous DQM games and the mechanics are so easy to get lost in. I love being able to speed through battles as grinding is a pain in any RPG. I know there are supposed to be frame rate issues later on but I've not reached that part yet and, having played Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for a year and a half, I'll cope!\n\n### Dragon Quest Builders 2\n\nThis was supposed to be a game my son and I could play together but he didn't like all the talking so I've played a bit on my own. Not as much as the others but it's been enjoyable. Minecraft meets Dragon Quest, what's not to love?\n\n## Videos\n\n### yr fave film critic\n\nMy friend Dom has a podcast series called [yr fave film critic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G) where he talks about film news, what he's watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It's so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)\n\n### Law & Order clips\n\nI watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said \"here, have some more\" and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn't conducive to good mental health.

I initially tried this on PS2 but the frame rate was so bad on the emulator (even on a Pixel 5), that I went for the 3DS version and it’s been great with the voice acting and the mechanics. Again, I don’t mind the grind as much especially with speed up and it’s not like Pokémon where you don’t necessarily need strategy (compared to VGC).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dragon-quest-xi-s\">Dragon Quest XI S\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Seeing how good this looked on PS4, I decided to get a PS4 Pro just so I could play it. Yes, it was already on Switch but I don’t regret the decision but it looks and plays amazingly and it’s a game I’m co-oping with my son which adds a unique element to it all. The voice acting is stellar, I actually enjoy the cut scenes for once, and it’s just a gorgeous game so far.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince\">Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I picked this up as a promotion treat and I’ve loved it so far. It has all the charm of the previous DQM games and the mechanics are so easy to get lost in. I love being able to speed through battles as grinding is a pain in any RPG. I know there are supposed to be frame rate issues later on but I’ve not reached that part yet and, having played Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for a year and a half, I’ll cope!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dragon-quest-builders-2\">Dragon Quest Builders 2\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This was supposed to be a game my son and I could play together but he didn’t like all the talking so I’ve played a bit on my own.

WordPress has [post formats](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/post-formats/) that can facilitate that. They are:\n\n* aside: like a note\n* gallery: a gallery of images\n* link: a link to another site (great for [linkblogs](/linkblog/))\n* image: a single image\n* quote: a quote\n* status: a status update, similar to a tweet\n* video: a video or video playlist\n* audio: an audio file or playlist\n* chat: a chat transcript\n\nMost of these I probably wouldn't much if at all but status intrigued me. I already use asides on all of my blogs front page but I wanted something different for those quick quips or musings. Because a lot of modern WordPress themes don't come with post formats out of the box, you have to enable them so I added this to my theme's functions.php file:\n\n```php\nadd_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'POST_FORMAT_NAME' ) );\n```\n\nThen you have to create a template for your format(s) (unless your theme has them already) and that's where I had to get really creative. Here's what a Bluesky post looks like:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/bluesky-post.jpg\" alt=\"a bluesky post by me that says bleh\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nTo get that working, I wrote a function in the template-tags.php file in my inc folder that retrieved my author name, my website (since it was also my Bluesky handle), and my avatar. All this info was accessible via the `get_the_author_meta()` function:\n\n```php\nfunction status_author() {\n    $author_avatar = get_avatar( get_the_author_meta( 'ID' ), 64 );\n    $author_name = get_the_author_meta('user_firstname') . ' ' . get_the_author_meta('user_lastname');\n    $url_cleanup = array(\"https://\" => \"\", \"/\" => \"\");\n    $author_url = strtr(get_the_author_meta('url'), $url_cleanup);\n    echo '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta\">' . '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta-avatar\">' . $author_avatar . '\u003C/div>' . '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta-text\">' . '\u003Cspan>' . $author_name. '\u003C/span>' . '\u003Cspan>' . '@' . $author_url . '\u003C/span>' . '\u003C/div>' . '\u003C/div>';\n}\n```\n\nI also added a bit to get rid of the URL scheme and all the slashes. Nice and neat! Then, I added the status_author() function to my template file (content-status.php):\n\n```php   \n\u003C?php if ( is_single() ) : ?>\n        \u003Ch1 class=\"entry-title\">\n            \u003C?php print_post_title(); ?>\n        \u003C/h1>\n\u003C?php else : ?>\n    \u003C?php status_author(); ?>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"byline-text\" style=\"margin-bottom:1rem;\">\n        \u003C?php the_content(); ?>                 \n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003C?php status_posted_on(); ?>\n\u003C?php endif; ?>\n\n\u003C?php if ( is_single() ) : ?>\n    \u003Cbr>\n\u003C?php endif; ?>\n\n\u003C?php \n\nif ( 'post' === get_post_type() ) : ?>\n\n\u003C?php\nendif; ?>\n\u003C/section>\u003C!-- .entry-header -->\n```\n\nWhat this says is to check if the page is a \"single\"—like a blog post—and if it is, add the title, otherwise add the status author info, the status text, and the date it was posted. I added some CSS to make mimic the Bluesky post design:\n\n```css\n/* please don't roast my CSS, I'm not a web dev!!! */\n\n.status-author-meta, .status-author-meta-text, .status-author-meta-avatar {\n    display: flex;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta {\n    margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text {\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    margin-left: 1rem;\n    letter-spacing: 0.25px;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text span:first-child {\n    font-size: 1.25rem;\n    font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text span:nth-child(2) {\n    font-size: 1rem;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-avatar img {\n    border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta + .byline-text a {\n    font-weight: 700;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta + .byline-text a:hover {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n```\n\nAnd \u003Cspan lang=\"fr\">voilà\u003C/span>!\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/status-post.jpg\" alt=\"a wordpress status post that says 'imagining a world where SEGA still made hardware and they battled with Nintendo in the 2000s and 2010s for handheld dominance'\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nOf course, how I put this together was specific to my setup and theme but the fundamental techniques are universal:\n\n* add theme support for formats\n* write the functions to get the author data\n* output it in a template\n* style it with CSS\n\nReclaim your status updates!","src/content/morsels/morsel-12.md","e45357d2d689d32f",{"html":1762,"metadata":1763},"\u003Cp>Even though I’ve deleted Twitter, I miss just throwing a thought out into the ether.

hidden—by `display:none`—or obscured by above-the-fold menus. I came across the latter the other day and the issue was lazy-loading. I wasn't sure whether the element classed as \"in the viewport\" despite not being immediately seen by the user unless they unfolded the menu.\n\nSo I looked for a way to check and came across a JavaScript method called `getBoundingClientRect()`. It returns a [DOMRect object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect) that shows the size (width and height) and position (x and y coordinates) of an element in relation to the viewport.\n\nThere are other ways to do it but this seemed the easiest for me (and coolest because I'd never heard of it before). [Here's an example taken from Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-current-viewport/):\n\n```javascript\nfunction myfunction(value) {\n    const item = value.getBoundingClientRect();\n    return (\n        item.top >= 0 &&\n        item.left >= 0 &&\n        item.bottom \u003C= (\n            window.innerHeight ||\n            document.documentElement.clientHeight) &&\n        item.right \u003C= (\n            window.innerWidth ||\n            document.documentElement.clientWidth)\n    );\n}\n\nconst elementToCheck = document.getElementById('div1');\n\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n    if (myfunction(elementToCheck)) {\n        console.log('Element is visible in viewport');\n    } else {\n        console.log('Element is not visible in viewport');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAfter I put my element in as the value of `elementToCheck`, it came up as \"in the viewport\" and therefore shouldn't be lazy-loaded.

I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they're worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.\n\n## 1. RKZ\n\nRKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I'm not Grade A broke!)\n\n[Website](https://rkzuk.com) | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rkzuk) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rkzuk) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rkzuk) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/rkzuk)\n\n## 2. Arkotype\n\nI'm simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the \"passion project\" of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pokémon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.\n\n[Website](https://arkotype.co/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arkotypeco)\n\n## 3. Alex Stewart\n\nI went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart's Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books [Moneyball](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780393324815), Soccernomics and The Numbers Game. I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that's how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AFHStewart) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/afhstewart)\n\n## 4. Liam Wong\n\nI love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his ['Tokyo Nights' (TO:KY:OO) project](https://www.liamwong.com/book). Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you're looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.\n\n[Website](https://www.liamwong.com/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/liamwon9/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/liamwong)\n\n## 5. Jer'Maine\n\nI have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It's no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer'Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of DatCode, a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.\n\n[#DatCode](https://gitdatcode.github.io/)\n\n## 6. Nguyen Le\n\n[Roger Federer](/jardim/sport/roger-federer/) fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I've been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn't poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.\n\n[Website](https://www.verse-co.com) | [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/newincreative)\n\n## 7. KUMA GOLD\n\nI can't speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that's where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I've seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can't wait.\n\n[Website](https://kuma.gold) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1oJv5fqPPUvH240dU5GZ9P?si=DUiijsvmSOelIfK1zg-SKg)\n\n## 8. The Music Snobs\n\nIt's been a while since their last episode but nobody does music critique better than The Music Snobs. I feel honoured to be in contact with the team - Arthur, Isaac, Snoop and Jehan - and welcome every opportunity for a conversation about our favourite artists. Their opinions don't always align with mine but I have a great respect for them and their articulation is second to none.

There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I've noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic \"I was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?\" retort. Well, what _did_ you expect?\n\nOf the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being \"misinterpreted\" and claiming \"if you don't say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid.\" (That's a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago. It was as follows:\n\n> “When I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen [...] She turned out to be witty and bright as well.”\n\nIt was later deleted after accusations of sexism. No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn't read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That's not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here's a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don't do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can't retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there's another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there's no chance of an alternative perspective - it's just bad.\n\nAnd that's precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I've overused that word and it's lost all meaning but it's a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it's very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it's not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who's getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.\n\nBut where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I've edited and published it. I think brevity is important for 2017 because online media in particular has suffered with linguistic saturation and an obsession with narrative. I recently wrote an unpublished article called [Football Is Dead](https://lastwordonsports.com/2017/01/13/football-is-dead/) where I rang the death knell on the sport thanks to its replacement: The Narrative. There's a lot of focus on talking and writing over the actual event and it isn't confined to the annals of sport. The news is overflowing with jargon, unnecessary words and ill-thought ideas. I've had to block The Guardian on Twitter because the opinion pieces coming through were terrible. I couldn't believe they got past an editor, both in context and general grammar and construction. My best writing has come from an academic perspective, where both brevity and nuance are crucial tools. I wouldn't have got a First for my dissertation without them. We need those tools for what we read and hear in 2017.\n\nThis won't dumb down journalistic output as some may suggest. Active writing can still flourish with care for succinctness and understanding of social differences. In fact, these ideas will bolster the messages needed. A clearly constructed message along with the follow through of action and education are vital in this fight against rising fascism. Trump and his ilk don't know the meaning of brevity and nuance. Publications like Inf0wars and Br3itbart are overflowing with offensive and confused rhetoric and because we're in a culture of more is better and they shout it the loudest, it's taken in by so many. That's not to say the direct opposite is what we need - talking quiet and saying nothing never solved anything. It's about saying and doing the considered amount with respect for the marginalised, particularly when their voice needs to be heard and not censored or quashed.","src/content/posts/2017-needs-brevity-nuance.md","97528d882f7a0858",{"html":2175,"metadata":2176},"\u003Cp>Firstly, happy new year to you all!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This post has been on my mind for a while and seeing as it’s the start of a new year, I thought it necessary to write it now while I’m in a writing mood.

It has caused me stress, anxiety, and exhausted me beyond belief. Sometimes, it was an urgent need for my time or expertise where panic was unwarranted. Or where I struggled with something and needed someone to be patient with me, but got the opposite. With my [ongoing journey through autism](/posts/probably-autistic/) and neurodivergence as a whole, I've noticed things I do that people can find difficult to deal with: mainly how I communicate and my issues with decisiveness. I'm not trying to be weird or make things hard for people; my brain just gets in the way of the best or simplest solution. But while I navigate that, I need people to give me time and space to get there rather than feel like I'm an inconvenience, being weird, or acting like a child. In hindsight, my neurodivergence has been around for decades and I've had to learn how neurotypical people act and respond accordingly. So I'm not a weird kid—I'm an adult who just needs some patience to get to where we all want to go. It's the least I deserve, especially when I actively give that time and space to other people.\n\nAnd that's where the need for assertiveness comes in. I went to my first CBT sessions back in 2017 (it was a pivotal year, evidently!) and assertiveness was something that cropped up a lot as something I needed. Elements of it have improved, particularly in work, but I could still do a lot better. In fact, I've arguably _regressed_ in certain areas of my life; backing down rather than saying something. I say it's to conserve energy and while that's true, there may have been times where I could have dealt with issues better if I'd been assertive rather than passive (or aggressive, another annoying go-to of mine). It's easier said than done but setting boundaries, being firm in them, and not backing down—even if there are uncomfortable conversations and reactions involved—is ultimately for the best.\n\nUltimately, I know people see me in a certain way and I have no intention of changing the things that they see. But knowing people treat me differently because of them, in a way I can see and feel, makes me sad. It's not about wanting to be normal or \"not me\" (been there, done that), it's about a wish for patience from others and for people to maybe stop and think about how they act and the impacts those actions have. Wherever we are on the everchanging planes of neurodivergence, we could also use a bit of care and time to ponder and reflect and make life a bit easier to deal with. I want that for me and if that can't be the default, I'll firmly prod you with my assertiveness rod until I get it.\n\nBut no worries if not, let me know xxx","src/content/posts/2024-patience-assertiveness.md","7871d00a177e6ff1",{"html":2212,"metadata":2213},"\u003Cp>I almost didn’t write this, but my friend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheArmchairAuteur\">Dom Griffin\u003C/a> made a video where he explained that sometimes, you just gotta do the work even when you don’t want to.

You don't even notice the time disappearing such is their ability to captivate. But what does this have to do with blogging? Well, the format can translate into your blog posts if you're running out of ideas. The debate over word counts, long vs short form, impacts on [SEO](/jardim/tech/seo/) and so on will continue forever but what you write needs to fulfill a purpose for the reader. A 1000 word essay doesn't automatically win over a 200 word piece because it has more content. Trying new ways of presentation can open new doors to new readers and potentially gain a fanbase.\n\nLet's look at those four sections:\n\n## Black Excellence → Celebration of achievements in your sector\n\nWherever you work, you'll be part of a wider community. It can help both you and the community to share the love and appreciation. From a personal perspective, I have Google Alerts set up with specific keyword terms and share stories relevant to my blogs. I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific \"excellence\" series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you've mentioned them.\n\n## Hot Tops → Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector\n\nThis is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads **must** know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.\n\n## Listener Letters → Q&A\n\nThis might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an \"agony aunt\" column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.\n\n## The Read → Opinion pieces, rants, critiques\n\nOp-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I've had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn't write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is **paramount** here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I've written pieces on cultural appropriation and it's important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don't feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn't be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier. Linking the two together will add more link juice which is a SEO's dream.\n\nDo you have any other format suggestions?

Give this [prompt engineering](/posts/prompt-engineering/) thing a go, read up on how it really works, and see what sticks and what doesn't. A great article I read a few weeks ago by Mitchell Hashimoto called [Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting\n](https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-transactional-prompting) touches on the objective and subjective nature of prompt design and where our LLM use cases fall. I'd found issues with using LLMs for generative purposes despite using all the techniques I'd found from language tech professionals. But Mitchell suggests that these use cases fall in the subjective category and that makes them hard to test for accuracy:\n\n> If we have an input that can produce an objectively correct (or I'd even argue \"mostly correct\") output, then prompt engineering can be successfully applied. Examples of problems with objectively correct results: information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\n> However, if we have an input that produces something subjectively correct, then prompt engineering is much less useful. The best example of subjective results are creative tasks such as art generation, writing, semantic search.\n\nOf course, people will&mdash;and should&mdash;argue that prompt engineering has helped improve creative tasks. But that also, arguably, requires the practioner to have a good understanding of their niche. A very good artist or writer with enough knowledge of what they want and how to achieve it via prompt engineering will get the results they need. It won't need testing either as they'll just know based on experience. But someone looking to cut costs and maximise profit will assume you say some magic words and press a button and it'll just happen because the AI bros said so and they're never wrong.\n\n## Cases where AI could be better\n\nMy main argument for AI as a last resort is stronger for those subjective channels of generation. However, with the objective channels such as \"information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation etc.\" (ie. most NLP problems) AI can go further up the pecking order. That's because tools for these tasks have existed for years and have shown varying levels of success. If they work for you, perhaps you don't need to consider AI at all. But if you need improvements or can't afford to pay for these tools (a better cost-cutting measure than firing writers I'd say), AI would be a good consideration. That's because language models in particular are very good at solving NLP problems, with minimal training or supervision. For example, my [RALTS classification tool](/posts/introducing-ralts/) uses [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) with [zero-shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) and the results have been good enough that I'd never want to fine-tune it. Here's how it classified this blog post:\n\n![A plot showing different classification categories for this post, analysed by a large language model.

We'd driven down the night before and stayed at a nearby hotel. We even had time to get some dinner in Luton town centre, which I'd not visited in about 6 years (much had changed and much had stayed the same). The flight out was delayed by over an hour due to fog but it went smoothly once we were up in the air. The journey from the airport to my hotel was as smooth as it had ever been the other 3 times I'd done it. I still marveled at having 4G underground. We stayed at the same hotel as before: Lisbon City Hotel. Our room was smaller than last time but big enough for what we needed: somewhere to chill and sleep. And we got a balcony which my partner took full advantage of.\n\nSince we got there early afternoon, we managed to have lunch at a place we'd visited the year before called Tapas n' Friends. The food was delicious and I practically inhaled everything, along with an espresso martini! When in Lisbon and all that. We then went shopping in Baixa-Chiado and I got a zipped jumper and some records. It'd been years since I'd gone crate digging so I relished the opportunity. The two LPs I got were Clues and Riptide by Robert Palmer.\n\nFor dinner, we hit a spot we visited last year called Pizza Wizard. My partner was eager to go back as was I and the pizzas did not disappoint. Great crusts, great dough, great toppings. I only had a few slices as I wasn't super hungry but it was enough and we left satisfied. \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">Obrigado\u003C/span>, Pizza Wizard!\n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/crispy-mafya-burger.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a chicken burger on a plate, covered in shredded cheese\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nOur first full day. We had breakfast, the classic continental breakfast with our favourite panpipe music playing on the speakers; it's become our thing now.\n\nWe decided to go to [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/) after missing it last year. Because they were redecorating the modernist section, we explored the main building which housed classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. The grounds are an homage to early 20th century modernism and Brutalism with its extensive use of concrete. My partner walked around and pointed out the various plants and we discovered one we'd never heard of before (the West Indian Lantana\n). We also had a drink and some \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">pastéis de nata\u003C/span> at the main café before we explored the art.\n\nWith time to kill, we took the Metro down to the coast and walked across to Cais do Sodre but before we did, we stopped off at a restaurant called Bel Forno. Great pizza and even better sangria that my partner enjoyed. Afterwards, we reached the Praça do Comércio and enjoyed the space and the sculptures around us before we stopped to watch a street performance (I will add their names once I find them!) It was very entertaining!\n\nOnce it was over, we made our way back to our hotel to rest before one final trip out for dinner to a place called Crispy Mafya. It's a fried chicken restaurant and, unlike last year, I was ready to have a proper meal. I had a \"New York Burger\" and it tasted so good. The ambience was super chill, even with occupied tables, and the music was perfect with a heavy slant on UK hip hop, grime, and drill (Giggs was on maybe three times? You love to see it!)\n\nA very cultured day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMonday started with a trip to Belém and an attempt to visit the Jerónimos Monastery. However, despite Google claiming it was open all day on Mondays... it wasn't (I've sent them proof so hopefully they change it so others don't make the same mistake). We took some photos and walked across to the Centro Cultural de Belém to see what happened to the old Museu Coleção Berardo (now called [MAC-CCB](https://www.ccb.pt/en/macccb/)). However, it was also closed on Mondays which I didn't realise until writing this just now 🤦🏽‍♂️\n\nWe took a long-ish walk across the main road to a little café/restaurant by the River Tagus (Rio Tejo) so we could eat and I could pee (lol). We both had a burger and chips with a ginger ale. Living the dream! The main reason for crossing over to the riverside was to visit MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology) and it had some new features since we visited last year. The biggest change was the renaming of the three sections of the museum, now called MAAT Garden, MAAT Central, and MAAT Gallery. MAAT Gallery had some new exhibits with art from Joana Vasconcelos, Mário Cesariny, and pieces from the Carmona e Costa Foundation Collection, Portugal's largest private collection. I really enjoyed the various art and my partner ADORED it, especially the textiles from Joana Vasconcelos's exhibit. I loved seeing her eyes light up 🥰\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/valkyrie-octopus.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a tentacular textile sculpture called Valkyrie Octopus\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Tentacular and spectacular!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nIn the evening, we went to our favourite restaurant: Atalho do Cais. For me, it has quintessential Portuguese/Brazilian vibes in terms of ambience and decor. But the food hails from different lands, serving a mix of Iberian meats and Japanese sushi dishes. The star of the show was the wagyu beef carpaccio that my partner might have loved more than me by the sounds of things 😂 but again, I was happy to see her so happy and enjoying the food and the atmosphere like I was. I had some fancy garlic bread, another burger, and a chocolate cake for pudding. I even had space for wedges and I'm sure everything was sprinkled with crack because it was all so moreish!\n\n## Tuesday - Terça-feira\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/sporting-cp-shirts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"three Sporting CP shirts \">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Vamos, Sporting!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTuesday was the day I revisited Estádio José Alvalade, Sporting CP's home stadium. It was the first time I'd been back since 2017 much to the faux-disdain of my partner who \"supports\" Benfica, a decision heavily influenced by their star striker, Gonçalo Ramos. The stadium also has the Alvaláxia shopping centre attached to it so we walked through there (I'd done the same before the match I went to in 2017) and then walked around the outside until we reached the team shop. I spent a long time browsing for things to get and in the end, my partner bought me a new shirt and a tracktop as an early birthday present and I got a notebook and pin for myself.\n\nFor dinner, we wanted to go back to Pizza Wizard but they weren't open, sadly. But their loss was another restaurant's gain as we had dinner at Anarchia. Again, gorgeous decor and delicious food. I wanted all their cutlery and crockery! Afterwards, we ambled back to the hotel, which wasn't far from the restaurant, and waited for 12:00am to clock over so I could usher in another year of my birth!\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/partner-oceanario-de-lisbon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"my partner looking at the sharks and fish at the Oceanário de Lisboa\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Beauty in nature\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nMy sixth birthday spent abroad, my fourth in Lisbon, and my second with my partner - but what to do? Well, after midnight, I opened one of my presents which was a Pokémon TCG Scarlet & Violet Elite Trainer Box and I opened a couple of packs (one had a pull!)\n\nAfter some much needed sleep, we had breakfast and got ready for the day ahead. We'd planned to go to the Oceanário de Lisboa again as we went last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. But i also wanted to visit the nearby Vasco do Gama shopping centre before heading down to our birthday dinner spot called Las Ficheras.\n\nOceanário de Lisboa was amazing, as expected. We traversed the different biomes, full of marine life both flora and fauna, before heading to the café for lunch. I had a pasta salad and apple crumble for dessert. Eating the crumble was excavating a fossil site it was so hard, but tasty nonetheless. We took a trip over the river via cable car and eventually found our way to the shopping centre. I got a few goodies from Fnac before heading back to the hotel to rest and making it back out to Las Ficheras for dinner. I had a quesadilla for main and a chocolate \"mousse\" for dessert (it wasn't as airy as expected but it was still sweet and tasty).\n\nOne of the best birthdays I've had in a while.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/cow-santa-outfit.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a cow dressed in a santa outfit\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Boo? More like mooo!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nOur last day in Lisbon.\n\nBecause our flight was in the evening, we had some time to kill so we headed to El Corte Inglés to get some Christmas tree decorations and have lunch nearby. I was sad to leave but it's become a ritual to start the festivities after my birthday and that cushioned the blow a little.\n\nI had a wonderful time and sharing it with my partner again was a significant factor in that. I can't wait to go back with her and be in my happy place with my favourite human being.","src/content/posts/another-week-in-lisbon-2023.md","d84618939066e7a2",{"html":2456,"metadata":2457},"\u003Cp>From 18th–23rd November, I spent another week in Lisbon with my partner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The journey has become a pilgrimage of sorts.

Because they were redecorating the modernist section, we explored the main building which housed classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. The grounds are an homage to early 20th century modernism and Brutalism with its extensive use of concrete. My partner walked around and pointed out the various plants and we discovered one we’d never heard of before (the West Indian Lantana\n). We also had a drink and some \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">pastéis de nata\u003C/span> at the main café before we explored the art.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With time to kill, we took the Metro down to the coast and walked across to Cais do Sodre but before we did, we stopped off at a restaurant called Bel Forno. Great pizza and even better sangria that my partner enjoyed. Afterwards, we reached the Praça do Comércio and enjoyed the space and the sculptures around us before we stopped to watch a street performance (I will add their names once I find them!) It was very entertaining!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once it was over, we made our way back to our hotel to rest before one final trip out for dinner to a place called Crispy Mafya. It’s a fried chicken restaurant and, unlike last year, I was ready to have a proper meal. I had a “New York Burger” and it tasted so good. The ambience was super chill, even with occupied tables, and the music was perfect with a heavy slant on UK hip hop, grime, and drill (Giggs was on maybe three times? You love to see it!)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very cultured day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"monday---segunda-feira\">Monday - Segunda-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Monday started with a trip to Belém and an attempt to visit the Jerónimos Monastery. However, despite Google claiming it was open all day on Mondays… it wasn’t (I’ve sent them proof so hopefully they change it so others don’t make the same mistake). We took some photos and walked across to the Centro Cultural de Belém to see what happened to the old Museu Coleção Berardo (now called \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ccb.pt/en/macccb/\">MAC-CCB\u003C/a>). However, it was also closed on Mondays which I didn’t realise until writing this just now 🤦🏽‍♂️\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We took a long-ish walk across the main road to a little café/restaurant by the River Tagus (Rio Tejo) so we could eat and I could pee (lol). We both had a burger and chips with a ginger ale. Living the dream! The main reason for crossing over to the riverside was to visit MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology) and it had some new features since we visited last year. The biggest change was the renaming of the three sections of the museum, now called MAAT Garden, MAAT Central, and MAAT Gallery. MAAT Gallery had some new exhibits with art from Joana Vasconcelos, Mário Cesariny, and pieces from the Carmona e Costa Foundation Collection, Portugal’s largest private collection. I really enjoyed the various art and my partner ADORED it, especially the textiles from Joana Vasconcelos’s exhibit. I loved seeing her eyes light up 🥰\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/valkyrie-octopus.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a tentacular textile sculpture called Valkyrie Octopus\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Tentacular and spectacular!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>In the evening, we went to our favourite restaurant: Atalho do Cais. For me, it has quintessential Portuguese/Brazilian vibes in terms of ambience and decor. But the food hails from different lands, serving a mix of Iberian meats and Japanese sushi dishes. The star of the show was the wagyu beef carpaccio that my partner might have loved more than me by the sounds of things 😂 but again, I was happy to see her so happy and enjoying the food and the atmosphere like I was. I had some fancy garlic bread, another burger, and a chocolate cake for pudding. I even had space for wedges and I’m sure everything was sprinkled with crack because it was all so moreish!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tuesday---terça-feira\">Tuesday - Terça-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/sporting-cp-shirts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"three Sporting CP shirts \">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Vamos, Sporting!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Tuesday was the day I revisited Estádio José Alvalade, Sporting CP’s home stadium. It was the first time I’d been back since 2017 much to the faux-disdain of my partner who “supports” Benfica, a decision heavily influenced by their star striker, Gonçalo Ramos. The stadium also has the Alvaláxia shopping centre attached to it so we walked through there (I’d done the same before the match I went to in 2017) and then walked around the outside until we reached the team shop. I spent a long time browsing for things to get and in the end, my partner bought me a new shirt and a tracktop as an early birthday present and I got a notebook and pin for myself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For dinner, we wanted to go back to Pizza Wizard but they weren’t open, sadly. But their loss was another restaurant’s gain as we had dinner at Anarchia. Again, gorgeous decor and delicious food. I wanted all their cutlery and crockery! Afterwards, we ambled back to the hotel, which wasn’t far from the restaurant, and waited for 12:00am to clock over so I could usher in another year of my birth!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"wednesday---quarta-feira\">Wednesday - Quarta-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/partner-oceanario-de-lisbon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"my partner looking at the sharks and fish at the Oceanário de Lisboa\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Beauty in nature\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>My sixth birthday spent abroad, my fourth in Lisbon, and my second with my partner - but what to do? Well, after midnight, I opened one of my presents which was a Pokémon TCG Scarlet &#x26; Violet Elite Trainer Box and I opened a couple of packs (one had a pull!)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After some much needed sleep, we had breakfast and got ready for the day ahead. We’d planned to go to the Oceanário de Lisboa again as we went last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. But i also wanted to visit the nearby Vasco do Gama shopping centre before heading down to our birthday dinner spot called Las Ficheras.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oceanário de Lisboa was amazing, as expected. We traversed the different biomes, full of marine life both flora and fauna, before heading to the café for lunch. I had a pasta salad and apple crumble for dessert. Eating the crumble was excavating a fossil site it was so hard, but tasty nonetheless. We took a trip over the river via cable car and eventually found our way to the shopping centre. I got a few goodies from Fnac before heading back to the hotel to rest and making it back out to Las Ficheras for dinner. I had a quesadilla for main and a chocolate “mousse” for dessert (it wasn’t as airy as expected but it was still sweet and tasty).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the best birthdays I’ve had in a while.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"thursday---quinta-feira\">Thursday - Quinta-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/cow-santa-outfit.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a cow dressed in a santa outfit\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Boo?

But alongside that, many of the issues I raised in the original article remain the same.\n\nAgain, I wasn’t surprised but I was still disheartened. Why was this still the case? Did those 3 years of listening and learning not make a difference? Why were there D&I initiative pages on agency websites but the Meet The Team pages were still predominantly white? It was something I just accepted before I entered the industry but I’ve been here for over 3 years now and I know I’m not the only one here.\n\nSo for this article, I spoke to some of the Black marketers who offered their thoughts 3 years ago, as well as some new ones, and asked them if they felt much had changed since then.\n\n## Participants\n\n* Jamar Ramos ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamarramos))\n* [Trevor Price](https://www.tvtrevphotography.com/)  ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorprice89))\n* Zenia Johnson ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeniajohnson))\n* [Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence](https://honeybeehome.co.uk/)  ([LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/melissa-reynolds-lawrence-232b1b32))\n* Clarissa Ankrah\n\n## What is office life like, 3 years later?\n\nI referenced Black representation in digital marketing in relation to microaggressions and “the experience starting and stopping at being a minority”.\n\nFor Jamar Ramos, there have been some marked improvements but racism still persists—albeit from a different source:\n\n> “Pre-2020, office life was terrible. I hated traveling 60+ minutes to get to, and leave, the office. I hated dealing with multiple meetings that could have been emails. I hated ignoring so many racist comments passed off as ‘jokes.’ Post-2020, the travel was better, the meeting load was the same, and the racist comments/jokes came from clients instead of coworkers.”\n\nHe elaborated on that, showing that microaggressions are still prevalent in the SEO space in particular: \n\n> “Clients consistently asked me what I did for the company, even though in email correspondence and on our company website, it was clear what I did. Now that I’m job hunting, the hoops I have to jump through and the consistent focus on the SEO aspects I don’t know intimately are very bothersome. I’ve also been told that a role I’d been recruited for was off the table because the company didn't have the budget for hiring anymore, only to watch that same company hire a white dude a few weeks later. All those black squares didn’t lead people to mirror their words to their actions.”\n\nPhotographer [Trevor Price](https://msha.ke/tv_trev/) hasn’t seen much change outside of COVID safety:\n\n> “Office life pre and post 2020 has more or less been the same save for some house keeping regarding covid safety practice. It has been pleasant but not necessarily pleasing if that makes sense. Office culture in my experience rarely changes as it has to be a major shift in the way a business operates for that to happen. For any successful business, the old adage of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind, however with industries unintentionally (or in some cases intentionally) dominated by a white (usually male) workforce they may not realise the system is broken until it’s too late.”\n\nClarissa Ankrah didn’t feel supported when she joined the industry in a few years ago:\n\nI really enjoyed having the flexibility to work abroad and take regular trips back to attend office days. It gave me a good sense of balance to connect with the team and explore new surroundings.\n\nHowever, starting a new field of marketing was challenging, and I sometimes found it difficult to seek support from my manager. I also found myself code-switching as the only black woman working for the company.\n\nFor Black women, the microaggressions are still more acute and stronger. In an article by Daphna Motro, Jonathan B. Evans, Aleksander P.J. Ellis, and Lehman Benson III entitled ‘[The “Angry Black Woman” Stereotype at Work](https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-angry-black-woman-stereotype-at-work)’, they looked at how the racist trope pervades office life in the US and prevent Black women from speaking out against discrimination:\n\n> “[...] Studies show people in organizations believe Black women are more likely to have belligerent, contentious, and angry personalities, an assumption not as readily assigned to other men and women. Recent studies suggest this negative perception is a unique phenomenon for Black women, and the researchers suggest that when Black women outwardly express anger at work, her leadership and potential are called into question.”\n\nAnd [for Black women like Lola Christina Alao](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-women-office-culture), office culture has been a drain, mentally and physically:\n\n> “Black women, like me, are often at a crossroads between wanting to take a stand against microaggressions at work and wanting to fade into the background to protect our peace. Being in the office, for me, meant feeling drained by 3pm, flattened by the weight of endless small talk and the constant pressure to be social, then the exhaustion I felt when I was judged for not wanting to be social.”\n\nZenia Johnson, who offered her opinions back in 2020, said there are pros and cons to working remotely but described some specific disadvantages for Black women:\n\n> “Well, in September 2020 I switched organizations and have been fully remote ever since. In some ways it's been really nice - I get to roll out of bed and go straight to my office, and I don't have a long commute to downtown Chicago so I get to spend more time with my husband and dogs, but also there are some things that I know I'm missing out on. I think this is true for everyone, but for black women in particular the face time that can come by being in office is REALLY important for relationship building and camaraderie. Otherwise, and I say this from experience, some people don't respect your role in the org and question your expertise.”\n\nMelissa Reynolds-Lawrence has seen some positive shifts compared to 3 years ago:\n\n> “Pre-2020, office life was teeming with microaggressions under the guise of 'humour'. I left a job where I felt like the angry black woman narrative was being pushed on me.\n\nPost-2020, the conversations around race are approached more sensitively and Black people that I know feel more comfortable speaking up and pushing back.”\n\n## Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022\n\nIn 2020, I remarked on the lack of Black voices in digital marketing publications and conferences. I have seen a small shift since then, thanks to the likes of Rejoice Ojiaku, Wilhelmina Gilbert-Davis, Anu Adegbola, Miracle Inameti-Archibong, and many more, particularly in the conference space.\n\nLast year, two prominent articles were published regarding the Black experience in digital marketing. The first was by Carla Thomas, former content strategist at Builtvisible, who wrote “[Let’s talk about race and diversity: breaking glass ceilings in digital marketing and beyond](https://builtvisible.com/lets-talk-about-race-and-diversity-breaking-glass-ceilings-in-digital-marketing-and-beyond/)”:\n\n> “2020 is a year that will go down in history. Amongst a swirl of magnifying events around the world, a well-needed spotlight was shone on race and diversity issues.\n\nMore specifically to the creative industries, in July [2020] The Independent reported that a lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the advertising industry leads to stereotyping; stereotyping which often harms society. Putting the importance of needing to reflect a realistic society aside, from a business standpoint diversity is proven to assist with accessing new customers and diversifying a customer base. Although we still have a long way to go, the good news is that the needle on workplace diversity is shifting.”\n\nThen in February 2021, as part of the Black History Month in the US, Adobe wrote “[Being a Black digital marketer in 2021](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/02/19/being-a-black-digital-marketer-in-2021)”. In it, they spoke to a variety of Black marketers about their experiences:\n\n> “Many Black digital marketers talk regularly about “being the only Black person in the room” and how uncomfortable that can feel.\n\n> “Having worked in various offices in my decades-long career, I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t either the only Black person in the office or one of a very small handful,” said Kelly Coleman, executive director of e-commerce at Tarte Cosmetics, where she builds and maintains innovative and effective customer experiences across all of Tarte’s digital properties.”\n\nFor Jamar, who had previous said he “hated being Black in digital marketing”, not much has changed in his outlook:\n\n> “If I could make a career change, I would. I like the money I can make and the people I’ve met. But, unfortunately, the industry talks about moving forward but consistently holds steady. Individuals want to make change, but institutions keep that change at bay.”\n\nMeanwhile, Zenia has felt a shift in how she approaches microaggressions, in that she actively approaches them compared to earlier in her digital marketing career:\n\n> “Having worked in digital marketing for my adult career I've had to work very closely with product and engineering teams - teams that tend to be very male and very white. Early in my career I felt uncomfortable confronting the microaggressions that would be leveled against me, or would question that I was even experiencing a microaggression. To give a few examples, I remember I was managing a team that included a man, and some people would go to him directly for advice or strategy and I was his manager. Or, to give another example (that has actually happened more than once!), when \"soul\" food was catered in the office, I would get a million questions about the greens and whether they were the \"real deal.\" I truly hope that white people have learned not to turn to the black person in the room when they get soul food delivered in the office (but in case they haven't, I'm even more grateful to be remote). Now that I'm a little further along in my career I don't put up with that and call it out when it's happening. I just reached the point where I couldn't code-switch or minimize my own feelings anymore, and I feel totally comfortable confronting a microaggression leveled against me or a junior team member who needs support.”\n\nMelissa also discussed her experiences with microaggressions:\n\n> “Comments about my hair texture. Being pulled up on my tone of voice because simply being friendly isn't enough. I had to overcompensate to be viewed the same as non-Black peers.”\n\nAnd on her general experiences in digital marketing:\n\n> “Generally positive but I am well aware that that's mainly because I'm good at code-switching.”\n\nClarissa’s experience with microaggressions involved use of both Black British Vernacular English and AAVE (African American Vernacular English):\n\n> “A lot of eye-opening experiences stunned me in my first role in digital marketing. I did feel at times that my former manager (a White male) did not know how to converse with me as a black woman. He would have a conversation in his dialect and occasionally would switch to using AAVE with me (I think that's the right term) by using phrases like \"you go girrrl\" or \"girrl\" (in an American accent I might add) to what I can only think to relate or converge with me, conversationally as an employee.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIn another event on a team call, they made a statement in an attempt to try and be \"funny' by saying \"mans a roadman innit?\" (with hand gestures) - everyone but myself laughed on that call. I suppose thinking of the connotations and the demographic of who the media and society label a \"roadman\" it did make me feel very uncomfortable and a small-minded comment to make that can be damaging.”\n\nAnd her experience in marketing:\n\n>“I haven't worked for many digital marketing companies or agencies but since leaving my previous role, matters have definitely improved. Working for a company that is more receptive to feedback to push diversity and support ethnic minorities as well as support their mental wellbeing is something I appreciate.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nContinuous training, mental wellbeing and pushing for diversity should be championed and implemented across the board.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nFor me, I’ve seen shifts but plenty of stagnation. People are still asking Black marketers to make themselves known to conference organisers and people making Twitter and publications lists, solely for the purpose of diversity. The question shouldn’t be how can we improve diversity and that question be left at the doors of Black marketers, it should be “why can’t the most prominent figures in an industry name more than one or two Black people—if that—to promote or offer a space on their panel?” And why are there constant calls for these lists and recommendations with no significant action at a recruitment or company level? What are these lists actually for? The sooner these questions are answered and actions made off the back of them, the better for our experiences.”\n\n## Racial biases in search—technically and personally\n\nIn the paper “[Algorithms are not neutral [PDF]](https://www.catherinestinson.ca/Files/Papers/Algorithms_are_not_Neutral.pdf)”, Catherine Stinson examined the bias found in algorithms and how they undermine people from marginalised groups:\n\n> “People from minority communities have noted that recommender algorithms do not work well for them. Noble documents the ways that search algorithms fail to serve the needs of black women. One of her examples is a hair salon owner who struggled to get her business to show up as a recommendation on Yelp when you search for “‘African American’, ‘Black’, ‘relaxer’, ‘natural”’, as keywords. Complaints about culturally inappropriate recommendations, such as white hairdressers being recommended for those search terms, or Christmas movies being recommended to non-Christians, are common online. Popularity and homogenizing biases may be at fault in those examples. A related issue arises when the recommender system does figure out that a user belongs to a minority group, but overfits to an essentialized version of that identity. That you cannot escape ads for Rupaul’s Drag Race if your online presence reveals any interest in LGBTQ+ issues stems from over-specialization.”\n\n> “There is some empirical evidence for differential effects of algorithmic bias on demographic groups. [...] Zafar et al. discuss “disparate mistreatment”, which arises when a classifier’s misclassification rates differ across social groups. An example (which stems from data bias) is how the COMPAS algorithm made more false positive errors with black defendants, labeling people who would not reoffend as being high risk while making more false negative errors with white defendants.”\n\nIt’s one of those situations where there have been improvements but not enough and not on a wider scale. And it’s something companies like Google acknowledge and state they can’t solve outside of specific use cases that marginalised people draw their attention to. In that case, why should I trust any of the company’s search or wide AI advancements? Won’t they carry racial bias? I’m tired of shrugging my shoulders at the lack of energy to stop harming people who look like me.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, Jamar noted the defence of bigoted rhetoric in relation to [a tweet calling out the male bias of “SEO experts” in a SERP](https://twitter.com/LidiaInfanteM/status/1582352202781569024):\n\n> “[...] when they reply with some tone-deaf argument that women and minorities need to do the work to change Google’s results when you look up SEO experts, racism in the industry is alive and well.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nWe have too many people who think this way and drop some respectability politics into the mentions to defend it. [...] Nothing we do can change the algorithm or the content it scrapes. That change needs to come from the SEOs making the lists and content that Google scrapes. The change needs to come from privileged white males, and this asinine need to make women and minorities do all the work to dismantle their oppression systems.”\n\nTrevor believed, to his knowledge, there had been no major shifts.\n\nZenia concurred:\n\n> “Has much changed? I don't think so. I'm still seeing the same lists published of \"best ppc experts\" or \"top SEOs\" of 2022, and they're all mostly white and mostly men. Conference headliners still skew very white and male. Leadership teams are still white and male.”\n\nAnd Melissa did too:\n\n> “I don't work exclusively in search but I am aware that many panels, conferences and events still centre white males as their most trusted contributors. More still needs to be done in the mainstream events to shine a spotlight on Black professionals in the industry - not because we're Black but because we're talented.”\n\nClarissa said she was disappointed by major brands’ inaction against racial bias until the damage was done:\n\n> “It's not something I noticed in my role at first, but I am aware of some AI presenting racial biases to black people. One thing I read a little while ago was that white content creators were able to monetise hateful terms and Google didn't blacklist this until being prompted to.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIt's very disappointing when big companies brand themselves on being just and prohibiting hateful speech, but not taking systems to block this right away when they clearly have the resources to.”\n\n## Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?\n\nIn 2020, I referenced a piece by Chanda Prescod-Weinstein called [‘Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up’](https://medium.com/space-anthropology/diversity-is-a-dangerous-set-up-8cee942e7f22) where she said trying to use science to analyse and fix racism was a dangerous proposition and that focusing on implicit bias at the expense of explicit bias and its impact could be harmful to the fight for equality. This year, she wrote a follow-up/reiterative piece entitled [‘About your diversity and inclusion requirement’](https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion):\n\n>“I almost feel silly writing this piece because I have written some version of it so many times. I wrote Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up and the Rules of the Diversity and Inclusion Racket. I also wrote long ago about the problems with the broader impacts criterion leading to students of color being treated like diversity props and minoritized scholars shouldn’t be forced to serve diversity.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI wrote, “The diversity racket is this: thinking that this is an intellectual exercise in being magnanimous, not a matter of survival.” I even wrote a whole chapter in my book about unwaged academic housework.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nSo I am tired and feel a bit silly but mostly furious because it is both ridiculous and deeply outrageous that it is necessary to write about this topic again, and surely this will not be the last time.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nBut also, as my grandmother Selma has said to me: I am shocked, but not surprised. Very little about the institutional relationship with “equity, diversity, and inclusion,” “diversity and inclusion,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and it’s newly extra woke iteration “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion” (JEDI, ha! so cute) surprises me. Because the institution’s goal is to survive, not to be better to us or for us. Our survival is not the institution’s goal. Our well-being is not the institution’s goal.”\n\nTrevor suggested diversity needed to be more specific and that more people from non-marginalised groups are speaking out:\n\n> “Honestly it means too many things to too many people. It comes down to the organisation and what fits their environment. If they are recruiting and they find that their applicants all look like clones, there’s likely a problem. The difference post-2020 is that now everyone is noticing it and feels empowered to point it out as opposed to just those affected by the lack of diversity (whether that’s race, gender or disability).”\n\nZenia believes organisational shifts have only been superficial:\n\n> “I think it means that organizations are more aware of the optics - they know what diversity should look like, they know the language to make it seem like they support diversity, but that hasn't resulted in meaningful change. Hiring practices are still the same, and these organizations have largely refused to re-invest in the communities that have been pillaged by decades of negligence and harmful capitalistic practices. The only difference is now there's maybe a DEI meeting once a quarter.”\n\nWhile Melissa wants to see a little less conversation and a little more action:\n\n> “It means almost the same but that people in leadership are being forced to actually pay attention to its meaning and the action. Back your chat, basically. I don't want to hear that you're listening and learning, I want to see that you're providing support, resources and opportunities.”\n\nClarissa believes diversity should be a responsibility at every level:\n\n>“In 2020, in the months of the Black Lives Matter protests, it was a time to bring to light the injustices but also showed support for black businesses, key figures and trailblazers all over the world. It presented the need for allyship and also recognised white privilege and how you can create a community with others by being open and willing to learn about the past, present and future.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI strongly believe that diversity needs to be in all areas, especially seniority. I say this because when their roles involve individuals, their wellbeing and progress, it's empowering and welcomes other perspectives which I believe is key to progression. I believe with a lot of things it's important to be intentional.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nThere tends to be an ongoing concern with performativity in organisations (I see it discussed with Black people I follow on social media) and how it is perceived by others. To me, this means not just speaking out about matters until certain events of the year (i.e. Black History Month) or until others are doing so. I can understand it can be (for a lack of a better word) scary, but it sets precedent for being unapologetically authentic. \n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nAlso, collaborating with others that are positively trying to make the digital marketing space by offering a soundboard for conversations to offer other perspectives is really important. As well as, cultivating relationships to be able to learn from one another.\n\nMy efforts within D&I have certainly evolved over the last 3 years. The Black Lives Matter protests radicalised me more than I expected and I’ve been more active in terms of donations to grassroots organisations and being vocal in the space. I started a newsletter this year that focuses on diversity and inclusivity within recruitment and retention and learnt (and unlearnt) a lot about what D&I should mean. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to bring “diversity” and “inclusivity” out of their buzzword comfort zones and into a reality where:\n\n* Workplaces have marginalised people at every level, not because it makes “business sense” but because marginalised people work too (is there ever a specific business case for employing white British men in the UK?)\n* They can feel safe to work and socialise without fear of micro and macroaggressions which get vehemently defended and subsequently backed up by HR\n* They can choose their own career path that doesn’t involve stunted growth patterns and goalpost shifting when it comes to promotions\n* They aren’t looked to for involvement in diversity and inclusion initiatives purely because they’re from a marginalised background and then made to feel utterly exhausted to the point they have to leave\n\n## What happened to the industry pledges after 2020?\n\nThere were a lot of pledges and responses to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 after George Floyd’s murder. We were told that eyes were opened, people stood with us as Black people, and that our voices would be amplified. But what has that all meant 3 years later?\n\nZenia praised her current employers for their subsequent actions but expressed her sadness at the lack of action from wider organisations:\n\n> “The company that I'm at currently, Outside Inc., has put forth a ton of effort DEI (sic). There is still work to do, but there is investment in third-party resources to continuously grade the organization and hold it accountable. I love that about this company, but I wish it held true everywhere. I have friends of color in the industry - at agencies and in-house, and they've seen very little follow-up to those demonstrative pledges. Yeah sure, you turned the org's social profile pic black, but what happened after that? It just feels so disheartening, and has caused a lot of my friends to divest from participation in DEI initiatives because they're not seeing results or meaningful change. They're doing the work elsewhere - via community organizations, mentorship, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI've also decided to take a break from participation in DEI work at work. Even being at an org that is doing the work well, I'm very tired. Working directly with mentees feels like more actionable and meaningful work for me right now. And to be frank, black folks have always done this work. After the disappointment of the last two years, it's ok for us to step back and take a break. It's time for allies to step in.”\n\nJamar echoed this sadness more strongly:\n\n> “The industry is okay with proximity to equity without any tangible equity being given. Conference lineups look relatively the same, and organizers continue asking women and minorities to nominate themselves for talks instead of doing work to identify new voices. In the months after George Floyd’s murder, I was hopeful the industry wanted to change. Now, I’m sure it doesn’t, and those of us who do will either need to work within a system that actively hates us or find solutions in other industries we might see a warmer welcome.”\n\nMelissa pointed out a need for better mental health support for Black employees:\n\n> “As far as the companies I have close contact with, I definitely see the conversations being continued but I'd like to see more support for Black people's mental health in the industry. Our experiences are uniquely different and so the resources should be too.”\n\nIt’s difficult to see what changes have been made when the pledges haven’t been reassessed a year or two later. [Moz wrote a statement in response to the BLM protests in June 2020,](https://moz.com/blog/black-lives-matter) followed by an update two days later responding to calls for evidence of their existing work. But no other updates since. On a personal level, I know my Twitter DMs were full of messages from non-Black colleagues asking for “sense checks” on statements, guilt, confirmation that I was “seen and heard”. It was very overwhelming and they continued even after I asked for them to stop. But they did eventually and after the dust settled, they rarely spoke to me about anything at all. And that’s how it has felt at an industry level since 2020\\. There are themed months on blogs, icon changes, and then 1st November arrives and it’s back to normal.\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\nHaving read Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s “[About your diversity and inclusion requirement](https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion)”, I empathise with her fatigue. It feels like a constant cycle of Black trauma bringing attention to systemic racism and people and enterprises becoming “aware”, making pledges, and watching the energy disappear over the space of a month. And Black people are always the one doing the work, making things known, and demanding change at every conceivable level whilst experiencing microaggressions, being passed up for promotions, getting fired, or not even finding work.\n\nWithin digital marketing, we’re acutely aware of racial biases in the search engine algorithms but also at an industry level in the lack of Black speakers at marketing conferences and Black marketers in agencies. And it’s not a case of nobody is doing anything but the actions are small and concentrated and can take a very long time to implement. They also need applied pressure—often from Black employees—to avoid them falling into the cracks. Amongst mounting deadlines and a mental health crisis amongst Black communities, it’s difficult to maintain that energy.\n\nSo the question becomes: where do we go from here, and who is “we”?\n\n> “We” should be everyone, regardless of race. That’s because white supremacy affects non-Black people too through non-racial discrimination. Therefore, institutional diversity and inclusion should be the work of everybody in an institution.\n\nA reminder of what I suggested 3 years ago:\n\n1. Actively call for Black candidates for all open roles and hire them\n2. Offer multiple paths for progression\n3. Make intersectionality and inclusion prerequisites of working life\n4. Provide transparency in salaries at all levels\n\nI still believe these things are necessary for Black marketers to feel more comfortable in their roles and places within the industry but I’d like to take it back further.\n\nI recommend everybody reckon with their own biases and the discomfort that comes with it. Too much of this work is obscured by guilt, a need to apologise to Black people for “The Past”, and seeking redemption. It’s not up to Black people to absolve the guilt of others. This defers the grace and space we should all give ourselves to acknowledge and do better. Once we face ourselves, then we can start looking outward and call out the discrimination before us.\n\nAfter that, it’s lifelong learning and action. That’s not the same as the listening and learning we heard incessantly in 2020 that amounted to nothing after the summer. There were plenty of anti-racism book lists published and, for some, those books were bought and left to collect dust on the shelf. The reading is a part of it but it’s not the full work. We also need to be mindful of what biases we perpetuate in our digital marketing. That includes optimising page titles that only say “Black man” or “Black woman” alongside negative stories— write their names . We also need to assess who we work with when it comes to link building. Many of the top news publications have histories of racism. Can we keep overlooking this?\n\nAnd finally, make Black people feel welcome. One of the primary results of microaggressions is to exclude, and often these exclusions are masked as obstacles or barriers of entry that \"affects everyone, regardless of race\". By doing the prior work, we can make healthy, open, and safe environments for Black colleagues to be themselves and grow but also choose not to be involved as is their prerogative. As for those barriers of entry, they need to be checked too, and **before** an incident occurs that causes unnecessary harm or frustration.","src/content/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023.md","5fda9eee36a7af69",{"html":2630,"metadata":2631},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>In a follow-up to my 2020 piece ‘Being Black in Digital Marketing’, I asked the same Black marketers if anything has changed in the last 3 years.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A lot has happened to me since I wrote \u003Ca href=\"https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/\">Being Black in Digital Marketing\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I changed jobs, changed roles, and have built something of a reputation in the industry.

I hated traveling 60+ minutes to get to, and leave, the office. I hated dealing with multiple meetings that could have been emails. I hated ignoring so many racist comments passed off as ‘jokes.’ Post-2020, the travel was better, the meeting load was the same, and the racist comments/jokes came from clients instead of coworkers.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>He elaborated on that, showing that microaggressions are still prevalent in the SEO space in particular:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Clients consistently asked me what I did for the company, even though in email correspondence and on our company website, it was clear what I did. Now that I’m job hunting, the hoops I have to jump through and the consistent focus on the SEO aspects I don’t know intimately are very bothersome. I’ve also been told that a role I’d been recruited for was off the table because the company didn’t have the budget for hiring anymore, only to watch that same company hire a white dude a few weeks later. All those black squares didn’t lead people to mirror their words to their actions.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Photographer \u003Ca href=\"https://msha.ke/tv_trev/\">Trevor Price\u003C/a> hasn’t seen much change outside of COVID safety:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Office life pre and post 2020 has more or less been the same save for some house keeping regarding covid safety practice. It has been pleasant but not necessarily pleasing if that makes sense. Office culture in my experience rarely changes as it has to be a major shift in the way a business operates for that to happen. For any successful business, the old adage of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind, however with industries unintentionally (or in some cases intentionally) dominated by a white (usually male) workforce they may not realise the system is broken until it’s too late.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa Ankrah didn’t feel supported when she joined the industry in a few years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really enjoyed having the flexibility to work abroad and take regular trips back to attend office days. It gave me a good sense of balance to connect with the team and explore new surroundings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, starting a new field of marketing was challenging, and I sometimes found it difficult to seek support from my manager. I also found myself code-switching as the only black woman working for the company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Black women, the microaggressions are still more acute and stronger. In an article by Daphna Motro, Jonathan B. Evans, Aleksander P.J. Ellis, and Lehman Benson III entitled ‘\u003Ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-angry-black-woman-stereotype-at-work\">The “Angry Black Woman” Stereotype at Work\u003C/a>’, they looked at how the racist trope pervades office life in the US and prevent Black women from speaking out against discrimination:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“[…] Studies show people in organizations believe Black women are more likely to have belligerent, contentious, and angry personalities, an assumption not as readily assigned to other men and women. Recent studies suggest this negative perception is a unique phenomenon for Black women, and the researchers suggest that when Black women outwardly express anger at work, her leadership and potential are called into question.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And \u003Ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-women-office-culture\">for Black women like Lola Christina Alao\u003C/a>, office culture has been a drain, mentally and physically:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Black women, like me, are often at a crossroads between wanting to take a stand against microaggressions at work and wanting to fade into the background to protect our peace. Being in the office, for me, meant feeling drained by 3pm, flattened by the weight of endless small talk and the constant pressure to be social, then the exhaustion I felt when I was judged for not wanting to be social.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Zenia Johnson, who offered her opinions back in 2020, said there are pros and cons to working remotely but described some specific disadvantages for Black women:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Well, in September 2020 I switched organizations and have been fully remote ever since. In some ways it’s been really nice - I get to roll out of bed and go straight to my office, and I don’t have a long commute to downtown Chicago so I get to spend more time with my husband and dogs, but also there are some things that I know I’m missing out on. I think this is true for everyone, but for black women in particular the face time that can come by being in office is REALLY important for relationship building and camaraderie. Otherwise, and I say this from experience, some people don’t respect your role in the org and question your expertise.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence has seen some positive shifts compared to 3 years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Pre-2020, office life was teeming with microaggressions under the guise of ‘humour’. I left a job where I felt like the angry black woman narrative was being pushed on me.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Post-2020, the conversations around race are approached more sensitively and Black people that I know feel more comfortable speaking up and pushing back.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"black-experiences-in-digital-marketing-in-2022\">Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 2020, I remarked on the lack of Black voices in digital marketing publications and conferences. I have seen a small shift since then, thanks to the likes of Rejoice Ojiaku, Wilhelmina Gilbert-Davis, Anu Adegbola, Miracle Inameti-Archibong, and many more, particularly in the conference space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last year, two prominent articles were published regarding the Black experience in digital marketing. The first was by Carla Thomas, former content strategist at Builtvisible, who wrote “\u003Ca href=\"https://builtvisible.com/lets-talk-about-race-and-diversity-breaking-glass-ceilings-in-digital-marketing-and-beyond/\">Let’s talk about race and diversity: breaking glass ceilings in digital marketing and beyond\u003C/a>”:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“2020 is a year that will go down in history. Amongst a swirl of magnifying events around the world, a well-needed spotlight was shone on race and diversity issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>More specifically to the creative industries, in July [2020] The Independent reported that a lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the advertising industry leads to stereotyping; stereotyping which often harms society. Putting the importance of needing to reflect a realistic society aside, from a business standpoint diversity is proven to assist with accessing new customers and diversifying a customer base. Although we still have a long way to go, the good news is that the needle on workplace diversity is shifting.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then in February 2021, as part of the Black History Month in the US, Adobe wrote “\u003Ca href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/02/19/being-a-black-digital-marketer-in-2021\">Being a Black digital marketer in 2021\u003C/a>”. In it, they spoke to a variety of Black marketers about their experiences:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Many Black digital marketers talk regularly about “being the only Black person in the room” and how uncomfortable that can feel.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Having worked in various offices in my decades-long career, I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t either the only Black person in the office or one of a very small handful,” said Kelly Coleman, executive director of e-commerce at Tarte Cosmetics, where she builds and maintains innovative and effective customer experiences across all of Tarte’s digital properties.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>For Jamar, who had previous said he “hated being Black in digital marketing”, not much has changed in his outlook:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“If I could make a career change, I would. I like the money I can make and the people I’ve met. But, unfortunately, the industry talks about moving forward but consistently holds steady. Individuals want to make change, but institutions keep that change at bay.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Meanwhile, Zenia has felt a shift in how she approaches microaggressions, in that she actively approaches them compared to earlier in her digital marketing career:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Having worked in digital marketing for my adult career I’ve had to work very closely with product and engineering teams - teams that tend to be very male and very white. Early in my career I felt uncomfortable confronting the microaggressions that would be leveled against me, or would question that I was even experiencing a microaggression. To give a few examples, I remember I was managing a team that included a man, and some people would go to him directly for advice or strategy and I was his manager. Or, to give another example (that has actually happened more than once!), when “soul” food was catered in the office, I would get a million questions about the greens and whether they were the “real deal.” I truly hope that white people have learned not to turn to the black person in the room when they get soul food delivered in the office (but in case they haven’t, I’m even more grateful to be remote). Now that I’m a little further along in my career I don’t put up with that and call it out when it’s happening. I just reached the point where I couldn’t code-switch or minimize my own feelings anymore, and I feel totally comfortable confronting a microaggression leveled against me or a junior team member who needs support.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa also discussed her experiences with microaggressions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Comments about my hair texture. Being pulled up on my tone of voice because simply being friendly isn’t enough. I had to overcompensate to be viewed the same as non-Black peers.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And on her general experiences in digital marketing:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Generally positive but I am well aware that that’s mainly because I’m good at code-switching.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa’s experience with microaggressions involved use of both Black British Vernacular English and AAVE (African American Vernacular English):\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“A lot of eye-opening experiences stunned me in my first role in digital marketing. I did feel at times that my former manager (a White male) did not know how to converse with me as a black woman. He would have a conversation in his dialect and occasionally would switch to using AAVE with me (I think that’s the right term) by using phrases like “you go girrrl” or “girrl” (in an American accent I might add) to what I can only think to relate or converge with me, conversationally as an employee.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIn another event on a team call, they made a statement in an attempt to try and be “funny’ by saying “mans a roadman innit?” (with hand gestures) - everyone but myself laughed on that call. I suppose thinking of the connotations and the demographic of who the media and society label a “roadman” it did make me feel very uncomfortable and a small-minded comment to make that can be damaging.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And her experience in marketing:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I haven’t worked for many digital marketing companies or agencies but since leaving my previous role, matters have definitely improved. Working for a company that is more receptive to feedback to push diversity and support ethnic minorities as well as support their mental wellbeing is something I appreciate.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nContinuous training, mental wellbeing and pushing for diversity should be championed and implemented across the board.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nFor me, I’ve seen shifts but plenty of stagnation. People are still asking Black marketers to make themselves known to conference organisers and people making Twitter and publications lists, solely for the purpose of diversity. The question shouldn’t be how can we improve diversity and that question be left at the doors of Black marketers, it should be “why can’t the most prominent figures in an industry name more than one or two Black people—if that—to promote or offer a space on their panel?” And why are there constant calls for these lists and recommendations with no significant action at a recruitment or company level? What are these lists actually for? The sooner these questions are answered and actions made off the back of them, the better for our experiences.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"racial-biases-in-searchtechnically-and-personally\">Racial biases in search—technically and personally\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the paper “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.catherinestinson.ca/Files/Papers/Algorithms_are_not_Neutral.pdf\">Algorithms are not neutral [PDF]\u003C/a>”, Catherine Stinson examined the bias found in algorithms and how they undermine people from marginalised groups:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“People from minority communities have noted that recommender algorithms do not work well for them. Noble documents the ways that search algorithms fail to serve the needs of black women. One of her examples is a hair salon owner who struggled to get her business to show up as a recommendation on Yelp when you search for “‘African American’, ‘Black’, ‘relaxer’, ‘natural”’, as keywords. Complaints about culturally inappropriate recommendations, such as white hairdressers being recommended for those search terms, or Christmas movies being recommended to non-Christians, are common online. Popularity and homogenizing biases may be at fault in those examples. A related issue arises when the recommender system does figure out that a user belongs to a minority group, but overfits to an essentialized version of that identity. That you cannot escape ads for Rupaul’s Drag Race if your online presence reveals any interest in LGBTQ+ issues stems from over-specialization.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“There is some empirical evidence for differential effects of algorithmic bias on demographic groups. […] Zafar et al. discuss “disparate mistreatment”, which arises when a classifier’s misclassification rates differ across social groups. An example (which stems from data bias) is how the COMPAS algorithm made more false positive errors with black defendants, labeling people who would not reoffend as being high risk while making more false negative errors with white defendants.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s one of those situations where there have been improvements but not enough and not on a wider scale. And it’s something companies like Google acknowledge and state they can’t solve outside of specific use cases that marginalised people draw their attention to. In that case, why should I trust any of the company’s search or wide AI advancements? Won’t they carry racial bias? I’m tired of shrugging my shoulders at the lack of energy to stop harming people who look like me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From an industry perspective, Jamar noted the defence of bigoted rhetoric in relation to \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LidiaInfanteM/status/1582352202781569024\">a tweet calling out the male bias of “SEO experts” in a SERP\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“[…] when they reply with some tone-deaf argument that women and minorities need to do the work to change Google’s results when you look up SEO experts, racism in the industry is alive and well.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nWe have too many people who think this way and drop some respectability politics into the mentions to defend it. […] Nothing we do can change the algorithm or the content it scrapes. That change needs to come from the SEOs making the lists and content that Google scrapes. The change needs to come from privileged white males, and this asinine need to make women and minorities do all the work to dismantle their oppression systems.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Trevor believed, to his knowledge, there had been no major shifts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Zenia concurred:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Has much changed? I don’t think so. I’m still seeing the same lists published of “best ppc experts” or “top SEOs” of 2022, and they’re all mostly white and mostly men.

This year, she wrote a follow-up/reiterative piece entitled \u003Ca href=\"https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion\">‘About your diversity and inclusion requirement’\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I almost feel silly writing this piece because I have written some version of it so many times.

I also wrote long ago about the problems with the broader impacts criterion leading to students of color being treated like diversity props and minoritized scholars shouldn’t be forced to serve diversity.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI wrote, “The diversity racket is this: thinking that this is an intellectual exercise in being magnanimous, not a matter of survival.” I even wrote a whole chapter in my book about unwaged academic housework.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nSo I am tired and feel a bit silly but mostly furious because it is both ridiculous and deeply outrageous that it is necessary to write about this topic again, and surely this will not be the last time.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nBut also, as my grandmother Selma has said to me: I am shocked, but not surprised. Very little about the institutional relationship with “equity, diversity, and inclusion,” “diversity and inclusion,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and it’s newly extra woke iteration “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion” (JEDI, ha! so cute) surprises me. Because the institution’s goal is to survive, not to be better to us or for us. Our survival is not the institution’s goal.

It comes down to the organisation and what fits their environment. If they are recruiting and they find that their applicants all look like clones, there’s likely a problem.

It presented the need for allyship and also recognised white privilege and how you can create a community with others by being open and willing to learn about the past, present and future.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI strongly believe that diversity needs to be in all areas, especially seniority. I say this because when their roles involve individuals, their wellbeing and progress, it’s empowering and welcomes other perspectives which I believe is key to progression. I believe with a lot of things it’s important to be intentional.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nThere tends to be an ongoing concern with performativity in organisations (I see it discussed with Black people I follow on social media) and how it is perceived by others. To me, this means not just speaking out about matters until certain events of the year (i.e. Black History Month) or until others are doing so. I can understand it can be (for a lack of a better word) scary, but it sets precedent for being unapologetically authentic.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nAlso, collaborating with others that are positively trying to make the digital marketing space by offering a soundboard for conversations to offer other perspectives is really important. As well as, cultivating relationships to be able to learn from one another.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>My efforts within D&#x26;I have certainly evolved over the last 3 years. The Black Lives Matter protests radicalised me more than I expected and I’ve been more active in terms of donations to grassroots organisations and being vocal in the space. I started a newsletter this year that focuses on diversity and inclusivity within recruitment and retention and learnt (and unlearnt) a lot about what D&#x26;I should mean.

We were told that eyes were opened, people stood with us as Black people, and that our voices would be amplified. But what has that all meant 3 years later?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Zenia praised her current employers for their subsequent actions but expressed her sadness at the lack of action from wider organisations:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The company that I’m at currently, Outside Inc., has put forth a ton of effort DEI (sic). There is still work to do, but there is investment in third-party resources to continuously grade the organization and hold it accountable. I love that about this company, but I wish it held true everywhere. I have friends of color in the industry - at agencies and in-house, and they’ve seen very little follow-up to those demonstrative pledges. Yeah sure, you turned the org’s social profile pic black, but what happened after that? It just feels so disheartening, and has caused a lot of my friends to divest from participation in DEI initiatives because they’re not seeing results or meaningful change. They’re doing the work elsewhere - via community organizations, mentorship, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI’ve also decided to take a break from participation in DEI work at work. Even being at an org that is doing the work well, I’m very tired. Working directly with mentees feels like more actionable and meaningful work for me right now. And to be frank, black folks have always done this work. After the disappointment of the last two years, it’s ok for us to step back and take a break. It’s time for allies to step in.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Jamar echoed this sadness more strongly:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The industry is okay with proximity to equity without any tangible equity being given. Conference lineups look relatively the same, and organizers continue asking women and minorities to nominate themselves for talks instead of doing work to identify new voices. In the months after George Floyd’s murder, I was hopeful the industry wanted to change. Now, I’m sure it doesn’t, and those of us who do will either need to work within a system that actively hates us or find solutions in other industries we might see a warmer welcome.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa pointed out a need for better mental health support for Black employees:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“As far as the companies I have close contact with, I definitely see the conversations being continued but I’d like to see more support for Black people’s mental health in the industry. Our experiences are uniquely different and so the resources should be too.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s difficult to see what changes have been made when the pledges haven’t been reassessed a year or two later. \u003Ca href=\"https://moz.com/blog/black-lives-matter\">Moz wrote a statement in response to the BLM protests in June 2020,\u003C/a> followed by an update two days later responding to calls for evidence of their existing work. But no other updates since. On a personal level, I know my Twitter DMs were full of messages from non-Black colleagues asking for “sense checks” on statements, guilt, confirmation that I was “seen and heard”. It was very overwhelming and they continued even after I asked for them to stop. But they did eventually and after the dust settled, they rarely spoke to me about anything at all. And that’s how it has felt at an industry level since 2020. There are themed months on blogs, icon changes, and then 1st November arrives and it’s back to normal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"where-do-we-go-from-here\">Where do we go from here?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Having read Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s “\u003Ca href=\"https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion\">About your diversity and inclusion requirement\u003C/a>”, I empathise with her fatigue. It feels like a constant cycle of Black trauma bringing attention to systemic racism and people and enterprises becoming “aware”, making pledges, and watching the energy disappear over the space of a month. And Black people are always the one doing the work, making things known, and demanding change at every conceivable level whilst experiencing microaggressions, being passed up for promotions, getting fired, or not even finding work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within digital marketing, we’re acutely aware of racial biases in the search engine algorithms but also at an industry level in the lack of Black speakers at marketing conferences and Black marketers in agencies. And it’s not a case of nobody is doing anything but the actions are small and concentrated and can take a very long time to implement. They also need applied pressure—often from Black employees—to avoid them falling into the cracks. Amongst mounting deadlines and a mental health crisis amongst Black communities, it’s difficult to maintain that energy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the question becomes: where do we go from here, and who is “we”?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“We” should be everyone, regardless of race. That’s because white supremacy affects non-Black people too through non-racial discrimination. Therefore, institutional diversity and inclusion should be the work of everybody in an institution.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>A reminder of what I suggested 3 years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Actively call for Black candidates for all open roles and hire them\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Offer multiple paths for progression\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Make intersectionality and inclusion prerequisites of working life\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Provide transparency in salaries at all levels\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>I still believe these things are necessary for Black marketers to feel more comfortable in their roles and places within the industry but I’d like to take it back further.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I recommend everybody reckon with their own biases and the discomfort that comes with it. Too much of this work is obscured by guilt, a need to apologise to Black people for “The Past”, and seeking redemption. It’s not up to Black people to absolve the guilt of others. This defers the grace and space we should all give ourselves to acknowledge and do better. Once we face ourselves, then we can start looking outward and call out the discrimination before us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that, it’s lifelong learning and action. That’s not the same as the listening and learning we heard incessantly in 2020 that amounted to nothing after the summer. There were plenty of anti-racism book lists published and, for some, those books were bought and left to collect dust on the shelf. The reading is a part of it but it’s not the full work. We also need to be mindful of what biases we perpetuate in our digital marketing. That includes optimising page titles that only say “Black man” or “Black woman” alongside negative stories— write their names . We also need to assess who we work with when it comes to link building. Many of the top news publications have histories of racism. Can we keep overlooking this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And finally, make Black people feel welcome. One of the primary results of microaggressions is to exclude, and often these exclusions are masked as obstacles or barriers of entry that “affects everyone, regardless of race”. By doing the prior work, we can make healthy, open, and safe environments for Black colleagues to be themselves and grow but also choose not to be involved as is their prerogative. As for those barriers of entry, they need to be checked too, and \u003Cstrong>before\u003C/strong> an incident occurs that causes unnecessary harm or frustration.\u003C/p>",{"headings":2632,"imagePaths":2654,"frontmatter":2655},[2633,2636,2639,2642,2645,2648,2651],{"depth":200,"slug":2634,"text":2635},"participants","Participants",{"depth":200,"slug":2637,"text":2638},"what-is-office-life-like-3-years-later","What is office life like, 3 years later?",{"depth":200,"slug":2640,"text":2641},"black-experiences-in-digital-marketing-in-2022","Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022",{"depth":200,"slug":2643,"text":2644},"racial-biases-in-searchtechnically-and-personally","Racial biases in search—technically and personally",{"depth":200,"slug":2646,"text":2647},"diversity-in-2023what-does-it-mean","Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?",{"depth":200,"slug":2649,"text":2650},"what-happened-to-the-industry-pledges-after-2020","What happened to the industry pledges after 2020?",{"depth":200,"slug":2652,"text":2653},"where-do-we-go-from-here","Where do we go from here?",[],{"title":2622,"description":2623,"published":16,"pubDate":2656,"tags":2657},"1 Oct 2023",[61,60,806,825],"being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023.md","beyond-tired-4",{"id":2659,"data":2661,"body":2666,"filePath":2667,"digest":2668,"rendered":2669,"legacyId":2677},{"title":2662,"description":2663,"tags":2664,"pubDate":2665},"Beyond tired: Part 4","Some thoughts on racism in football and in general",[60,61,825],["Date","2021-07-11T23:00:00.000Z"],"Don't tell me you're disgusted at racism against Black footballers.  \n\nDon't tell me you're shocked it's happening.  \n\nDon't tell me it's 2021.  \n\nWe fucking know.

I didn't just immerse myself in it recently?\" that's what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. \"died\" in Infinity War&mdash;actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now).

You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I've always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn't belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn't crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we *could* achieve.\n\nAnd that's why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people.

It is also true.\n\nIt is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn’t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, “reality” TV shows. What you see isn’t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren’t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we’re still told it’s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it’s real but it’s not real at the same time.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the “development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals”. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one’s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.\n\nThe simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn’t real and that it was just a programme. This isn’t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said “cut”, the “dead” person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.\n\nThis proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn’t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying “unreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world”, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.\n\nI have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and “interact”. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It’s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I’ve done it in the past, I’m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these “personas” are shed and don’t pass through.\n\nThe whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don’t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called “leet speak” in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn’t perceived to be warranted (I’ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique “language” to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.\n\nDavid Boyle’s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn’t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don’t have to listen to a word I’ve said. These aren’t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation.

But now’s the time to acknowledge my achievements. Why did I call this post “Eight”? Because it took me 8 years to get to where I wanted to be. I joked to a colleague that I’d made it out of Shawshank and that’s how it felt. who I crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side (metaphorically of course). I finally had an answer to the question I couldn’t answer. I’ve been writing for Sampleface now for 7 years this year. It’s not as popular as it used to be but I still write. Nothing will stop me writing bar a loss of upper extremities. I like to inform, to exhibit, and to teach.

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 7 things I've picked up over that period.",[806,590,236],["Date","2024-03-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Today marks the fifth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (you can [read about my first year](/posts/first-year-professional-seo/), [second year](/posts/second-year-professional-seo/), [third year](/posts/third-year-professional-seo/), and [fourth year](/posts/fourth-year-professional-seo/) to follow my journey).\n\nIt's been an amazing journey so far and I like to share what I've learnt every year so here are some of my lessons from my fifth year as a professional.\n\n## People\n\n### 1. John Mueller still remains the MVP\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, thank you for your patience, hard work, and technical support. Same as last year. And the years before.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 2. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science have waxed and waned\n\nLast year, I said that AI, web performance, and graph science had \"enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined\" and while that's still true, they haven't all continued on an upward trajectory. I did an AI webinar last year and released a tool (which is effectively a OpenAI wrapper with some Python automation, built primarily for entry-level use) but my personal feelings have decreased as AI tech is used as an excuse to put people out of work and retain profits for capitalists. Now, I use generative AI sparingly and general NLP a bit more. Web performance still remains a passion although I still don't like how it's used as a beacon for ranking improvements when its focus should be on revenue and session quality attribution. And I haven't touched graph science for a long time. neo4j still isn't functional on M1 or M2 Mac chips and that's the only way I used it. I don't have the energy to find alternatives and learn a whole new UI.\n\n### 3. Python still rocks and I'm learning JavaScript (again)\n\nI'm building more tools in Python and it feels good. I'm also trying to learn JavaScript again because it matters for my work more than ever and I've been putting it off for years.\n\n### 4. I still love web performance\n\nI'm still doing lots of Core Web Vitals audits but now pushing back (in my head) on them for sites where site speed isn't a priority. If a site is small, CWV scores won't do anything for ranking and there are always bigger priorities.\n\nAnd I still say that synthetic data is important and we can build a more inclusive Web for everyone if we care enough and put in the work (sadly, I've not found a way to show this in a work capacity that DOESN'T involve a business case)\n\n## Misc\n\n### 5. Seriously, stop using (generative) AI for *everything*\n\nNLP, embeddings, vector search, clustering, fuzzy matching, all that kind of stuff? Good. It's under the AI umbrella and I think they are good use cases when done properly. But most of that isn't sexy so we're stuck with generative AI as the poster boy and a lot of it sucks. I've written that generative AI works well as a creative kickstarter but that's not how it's sold or how most people use it. Everyone complains about search results pages being filled with AI garbage written for the sake of SEO and The Verge are taking the lead on calling SEO out for a lot of the blame (with varying success, I won't go into it here because it bores and annoys me). We could just not use it so much and take care in how we use it. But experts couldn't pretend to know-it-all and sell us all snake oil and apparently, that's worse.\n\n#### 5a. I find generative AI really boring\n\nI've used generative AI a fair bit in the last few years but I apply some critical thinking to what I do because a lot of it isn't tested thoroughly and it's not scaled for mass use (tl;dr - it's not really at an adequate production level). The problem is, I see a lot of use cases that are promoted as \"something for everything\" but without any indication of methodology or testing. And everyone seems to be okay with it because they say \"ooh, interesting!\" And I honestly find this repetitive cycle boring. Generative AI may produce coherent sentences but they're soulless and even if you get a human to juj it up, why not just get the human to write it. Now, I've mentioned that [generative AI is good as a kickstarter](/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/) and I stand by that. But so many people are trying to hoodwink us, pretending that things have been checked when they haven't. We already have soulless, stale content written by humans—generative AI models only speed that process up and that's not innovation for me.\n\n### 6. I don't want to see your keyword/traffic graphs\n\nIn or out of context, all these Google Search Console and Ahrefs graphs mean nothing. And even with added information on how you scaled 100s of pages with templated text, you just look bad and that traffic will go the opposite way and you'll blame Google rather than yourself. If you start a website with no content and then start adding indexable content, your lines will eventually go up. It's not magic, it's not strategy, it's just how search engines work. Please stop.\n\n### 7. We all need to get our priorities straight\n\nSaving the best til last. I've had to learn that a lot of what we're asked to do or think we need to do isn't that important in the grander scheme of things. Site speed for most small sites isn't a priority compared to \"helpful content\" (unless the site is so slow that it's unusable and this often isn't the case, at least in my experience). Meta descriptions? Not a priority compared to literally anything. Bold keywords, keyword density, word count, \"LSI keywords\", keywords in headings, all things that should never be looked at or made priorities.\n\nAnd beyond the technicalities of our work, we also need to get it together from a moral and human perspective. Who are we working with and what do we stand for? I wrote about being [Black in digital marketing last year](/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/) and it was sad to see so many of those micro and macroaggressions still prevalent 3 years later. D&I is getting cut heavily in the tech industry and what is left isn't working for everyone. I get that these things are a work in progress but the **_progress_** isn't the thing to applaud and feel good about. And we shouldn't need data to justify actions—we should just be doing the actions, which goes beyond D&I.\n\nThe reality is that people think SEO is spammy crap. Whether that's true or not might not the thing to focus on. What these figure heads should be doing is demystifying a lot of our practices, not couch everything in vague language as to obscure what's really happening, and stop walling free information. There are plenty of things Google could do but profit and notoriety comes first. That doesn't mean we shouldn't keep fighting them on their crap practices but we should also keep our expectations in check. We won't find out what all the algorithms and factors are.

My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science have waxed and waned\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Last year, I said that AI, web performance, and graph science had “enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined” and while that’s still true, they haven’t all continued on an upward trajectory. I did an AI webinar last year and released a tool (which is effectively a OpenAI wrapper with some Python automation, built primarily for entry-level use) but my personal feelings have decreased as AI tech is used as an excuse to put people out of work and retain profits for capitalists. Now, I use generative AI sparingly and general NLP a bit more. Web performance still remains a passion although I still don’t like how it’s used as a beacon for ranking improvements when its focus should be on revenue and session quality attribution. And I haven’t touched graph science for a long time. neo4j still isn’t functional on M1 or M2 Mac chips and that’s the only way I used it.

Seriously, stop using (generative) AI for \u003Cem>everything\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>NLP, embeddings, vector search, clustering, fuzzy matching, all that kind of stuff? Good. It’s under the AI umbrella and I think they are good use cases when done properly. But most of that isn’t sexy so we’re stuck with generative AI as the poster boy and a lot of it sucks. I’ve written that generative AI works well as a creative kickstarter but that’s not how it’s sold or how most people use it. Everyone complains about search results pages being filled with AI garbage written for the sake of SEO and The Verge are taking the lead on calling SEO out for a lot of the blame (with varying success, I won’t go into it here because it bores and annoys me). We could just not use it so much and take care in how we use it. But experts couldn’t pretend to know-it-all and sell us all snake oil and apparently, that’s worse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"5a-i-find-generative-ai-really-boring\">5a. I find generative AI really boring\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>I’ve used generative AI a fair bit in the last few years but I apply some critical thinking to what I do because a lot of it isn’t tested thoroughly and it’s not scaled for mass use (tl;dr - it’s not really at an adequate production level). The problem is, I see a lot of use cases that are promoted as “something for everything” but without any indication of methodology or testing. And everyone seems to be okay with it because they say “ooh, interesting!” And I honestly find this repetitive cycle boring. Generative AI may produce coherent sentences but they’re soulless and even if you get a human to juj it up, why not just get the human to write it. Now, I’ve mentioned that \u003Ca href=\"/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/\">generative AI is good as a kickstarter\u003C/a> and I stand by that. But so many people are trying to hoodwink us, pretending that things have been checked when they haven’t. We already have soulless, stale content written by humans—generative AI models only speed that process up and that’s not innovation for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"6-i-dont-want-to-see-your-keywordtraffic-graphs\">6. I don’t want to see your keyword/traffic graphs\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In or out of context, all these Google Search Console and Ahrefs graphs mean nothing. And even with added information on how you scaled 100s of pages with templated text, you just look bad and that traffic will go the opposite way and you’ll blame Google rather than yourself. If you start a website with no content and then start adding indexable content, your lines will eventually go up. It’s not magic, it’s not strategy, it’s just how search engines work. Please stop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"7-we-all-need-to-get-our-priorities-straight\">7. We all need to get our priorities straight\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Saving the best til last. I’ve had to learn that a lot of what we’re asked to do or think we need to do isn’t that important in the grander scheme of things. Site speed for most small sites isn’t a priority compared to “helpful content” (unless the site is so slow that it’s unusable and this often isn’t the case, at least in my experience). Meta descriptions? Not a priority compared to literally anything. Bold keywords, keyword density, word count, “LSI keywords”, keywords in headings, all things that should never be looked at or made priorities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And beyond the technicalities of our work, we also need to get it together from a moral and human perspective. Who are we working with and what do we stand for? I wrote about being \u003Ca href=\"/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/\">Black in digital marketing last year\u003C/a> and it was sad to see so many of those micro and macroaggressions still prevalent 3 years later. D&#x26;I is getting cut heavily in the tech industry and what is left isn’t working for everyone. I get that these things are a work in progress but the \u003Cstrong>\u003Cem>progress\u003C/em>\u003C/strong> isn’t the thing to applaud and feel good about. And we shouldn’t need data to justify actions—we should just be doing the actions, which goes beyond D&#x26;I.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The reality is that people think SEO is spammy crap. Whether that’s true or not might not the thing to focus on. What these figure heads should be doing is demystifying a lot of our practices, not couch everything in vague language as to obscure what’s really happening, and stop walling free information. There are plenty of things Google could do but profit and notoriety comes first. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep fighting them on their crap practices but we should also keep our expectations in check. We won’t find out what all the algorithms and factors are. Even these reports claiming they know what they are (looking at you, Backlinko) aren’t that helpful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I once said that I liked SEO academically but disliked the industry.

But what have I learnt? I wrote a list of 19 things I''ve picked up over that period.",[806],["Date","2020-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"I'm a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.\n\n[I wrote about my journey in digital marketing](/posts/eight/) when I got my job. Here is what I've learnt in my first year as a professional.\n\n## People\n### Women in SEO are the best\n\nWhen I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren't white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It's the best decision I've ever made.\n\nI've learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I'm grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.\n\n### Experts aren't experts\n\nI followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won't name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.\n\nI've seen a lot of \"expert\" opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I'm not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn't have a place in search.\n\n### There's still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)\n\nI used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn't see any people like me. It didn't bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.\n\nAnd now I'm \"in\", I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word \"diversity\" now as it's lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that's how capitalism works.\n\nThere's still a sexism problem. It's not as bad as it used to be but there's still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.\n\n### brightonSEO\n\nA friend of mine went to [brightonSEO](https://brightonseo.com/) one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I'm going again this year, with more experience under my belt.\n\nI loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year's being just as good if not better.\n\n## Keywords\n### It's about topics, not individual keywords\n\nI spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.\n\nSuddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines. \n\n### Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight\n\nI've been [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) for over a decade and most of the time, I don't write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)\n\n## Technical\n### Technical SEO is my strong suit\n\nI used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I've honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that's where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.\n\n### Python is amazing\n\nI know HTML isn't a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn't for me. And now I hate C++.\n\nLater on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I've already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about [Python's potential in paid search](https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/).\n\nI've still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.\n\n### JavaScript is overused\n\nThis has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I'm not saying it's useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it's just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn't the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).\n\nDoes a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I'm not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn't the solution to everything on the Web.\n\n### APIs are amazing\n\nIs there anything APIs can't do? Actually, don't answer that.\n\nAn API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself \"does this have an API\" and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. [Pokémon](https://pokeapi.co/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They're a great way to practise in your language of choice.\n\n## Content and Links\n### Use headings more\n\nMy scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.\n\nHeadings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they're not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don't help with ranking).\n\n### The inverted pyramid model is a good idea\n\n[The inverted pyramid model](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html) is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you'll read more. I've heard naysayers claim TL;DR's kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as [featured snippets](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/)), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they're ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.\n\n### There's a lot of the same content out there\n\nToday, I found an article called [Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out](https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/) and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:\n\n> There’s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you’ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, “SEO content” has become a synonym for meandering “ultimate guides” and formulaic “7 ways” listicles.\n\nWhen analysing the SERPs for intent, we're told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the \"best\" content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there's more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there's a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.\n\n### Internal linking is important\n\nI never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn't know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you're writing good content that links to more good content, you're going to keep a user on your site. And if it's an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.\n\n### So is a good architecture\n\nSomething else I didn't pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. [Crawl depth](https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/) is an issue (I'm working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.\n\n## Google\n### Google is not a meritocracy\n\n[I wrote a piece on this](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/)] so I won't repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.\n\n### But John Mueller is awesome\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.\n\n## Misc\n### I love the Web even more\n\nI've loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School's library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it's used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.\n\n### I love not doing SEO\n\nSeems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those \"best practices\". Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because [it's not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/)).\n\nIf I want to write about something, I'll write about it. There's no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured \"for Google\". My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don't rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won't let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to [Natalie Arney](https://nataliearney.com/), [Ruth Everett](https://twitter.com/rvtheverett), [Ronke Lawal](https://www.ronkelawal.com/), Tony Randall, [Tom Mortimer](https://twitter.com/tomaszmortimer), Jess Kirkbride, Danielle Strouther, Amber Dawson, [Areej AbuAli](https://www.areejabuali.com/), Dan Rice, [Tatiana Mac](https://www.tatianamac.com/), [Maret Reutelingsperger](https://twitter.com/itsmaret), and other people I'll invariably add later on.

Which leads me onto the next heading.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"python-is-amazing\">Python is amazing\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I know HTML isn’t a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp\">C++\u003C/a>. I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn’t for me. And now I hate C++.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Later on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I’ve already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/\">Python’s potential in paid search\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"javascript-is-overused\">JavaScript is overused\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I’m not saying it’s useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing… it’s just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn’t the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Does a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I’m not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn’t the solution to everything on the Web.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"apis-are-amazing\">APIs are amazing\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything APIs can’t do? Actually, don’t answer that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself “does this have an API” and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. \u003Ca href=\"https://pokeapi.co/\">Pokémon\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api\">Spotify\u003C/a> are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They’re a great way to practise in your language of choice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"content-and-links\">Content and Links\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"use-headings-more\">Use headings more\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>My scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Headings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they’re not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don’t help with ranking).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-inverted-pyramid-model-is-a-good-idea\">The inverted pyramid model is a good idea\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-inverted-pyramid-in-journalistic-writing.html\">The inverted pyramid model\u003C/a> is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you’ll read more. I’ve heard naysayers claim TL;DR’s kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/\">featured snippets\u003C/a>), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they’re ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"theres-a-lot-of-the-same-content-out-there\">There’s a lot of the same content out there\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Today, I found an article called \u003Ca href=\"https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/\">Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out\u003C/a> and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>There’s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you’ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, “SEO content” has become a synonym for meandering “ultimate guides” and formulaic “7 ways” listicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>When analysing the SERPs for intent, we’re told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the “best” content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there’s more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there’s a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"internal-linking-is-important\">Internal linking is important\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn’t know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you’re writing good content that links to more good content, you’re going to keep a user on your site. And if it’s an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"so-is-a-good-architecture\">So is a good architecture\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Something else I didn’t pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/\">Crawl depth\u003C/a> is an issue (I’m working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"google\">Google\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"google-is-not-a-meritocracy\">Google is not a meritocracy\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/\">I wrote a piece on this\u003C/a>] so I won’t repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"but-john-mueller-is-awesome\">But John Mueller is awesome\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>John, if you’re reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"misc\">Misc\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"i-love-the-web-even-more\">I love the Web even more\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I’ve loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School’s library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it’s used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"i-love-not-doing-seo\">I love not doing SEO\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Seems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those “best practices”. Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because \u003Ca href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/\">it’s not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I want to write about something, I’ll write about it. There’s no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured “for Google”. My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don’t rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won’t let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"shout-outs\">Shout outs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Thank you to \u003Ca href=\"https://nataliearney.com/\">Natalie Arney\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rvtheverett\">Ruth Everett\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ronkelawal.com/\">Ronke Lawal\u003C/a>, Tony Randall, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tomaszmortimer\">Tom Mortimer\u003C/a>, Jess Kirkbride, Danielle Strouther, Amber Dawson, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.areejabuali.com/\">Areej AbuAli\u003C/a>, Dan Rice, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.tatianamac.com/\">Tatiana Mac\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/itsmaret\">Maret Reutelingsperger\u003C/a>, and other people I’ll invariably add later on.

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 8 things I've picked up over that period.",[806,590],["Date","2023-03-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Today marks the fourth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year](/posts/first-year-professional-seo/), [my second year](/posts/second-year-professional-seo/)), and [my third year](/posts/third-year-professional-seo/)).\n\nHere is what I've learnt in my fourth year as a professional.\n\n## People\n\n### 1. SEOs still love experts, even when they pass off second-hand information\n\nI still get called an \"expert\" in things. I'm still grateful for the recognition in my field. I still don't personally own that accolade. Many others still do despite primarily passing off second-hand information from experts outside [SEO](/jardim/tech/seo/) (I'm referring to [AI](/jardim/tech/ai/)).\n\nIf you want someone who knows their stuff in a different field, talk to someone in that field. Read papers, watch videos, attend conferences. Don't follow the sole advice of a \"SEO guru\" (eww, David!), and especially one that doesn't expand on the key areas of interest (such as biases and harms).\n\n### 2. John Mueller remains the MVP\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year. And the years before.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 3. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science continue to grow\n\nThese three disciplines have enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined. I have used them all fairly regularly in my professional work over the last year and they've given me incredible insights and saved a lot of time. My next step is to standardise some of my approaches.\n\n### 4. Python still rocks and I'm back in the game\n\nI'd taken a bit of a break last year and the year before due to mental health but I'm back on the Python train and creating a whole load of techniques and scripts. You can see some of them on my Morsels page above.\n\n### 5. I love web performance\n\nCore Web Vitals was always a bit of a stumbling block for me. Because of how it was portrayed in the industry, it felt like a necessity and could only be done one way. But having done _so_ many audits in the last year, I've grown to understand what matters and what doesn't.\n\nAnd I will say this: synthetic data (aka lab data) and RUM data (aka field data) have their places in web performance and it's important to look at both when making changes because iPhone 14 users on 5G in the UK and US aren't the only people on the internet.\n\n## Misc\n\n### 6. Please stop using AI for bad things\n\nAsk yourself: will this cause harm to someone or a group of people in some way? Am I taking work away from someone who needs it? If the answer is yes, don't use AI for that thing. People should always come first in making these decicions and even if you do use AI for a task, people must be involved at every single stage.\n\nBecause most of AI use we see today involves some kind of model, underpinned by probabilities of the \"right\" output and put into the world with a healthy dose of confirmation bias (ie. well, I don't know how it got to that answer but this machine gave me something human-like so it must be okay).\n\nHallucinations can and do cause harm. Stop it. Get some (human) help.\n\n### 7. It's okay to not be okay, except all the times when it isn't\n\nSomething happened to me recently that shook me for a few days. It reminded me why I never used to open up to people or let myself be vulnerable and it comes down to how people throw slogans and platitudes in times of notable grief (e.g. when someone famous dies or there is a major world event) but when the dust settles, it's back to the same old lines&mdash;_don't do that, it makes me uncomfortable_.\n\nBut I won't go back in my shell. When I'm not okay, people who need to know will know. And those who don't because of how I've seen them act when people around the struggle won't get my grace.\n\n### 8. The industry still isn't great and AI is gonna make it worse\n\nEgos are still rampant in SEO but now that we have AI, I feel like it's going to get worse. [Prompt engineering](/posts/prompt-engineering/) is the latest craze that [I'd previously tweeted about as a close analogue to Facebook's video pivot controversy. We still don't know why these prompts work in the way they do but damned if someone with an expert complex is gonna be honest about that!\n\nLemme just say to be careful whose words you follow as gospel. And read papers by language tech pros and ask them questions instead.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to:\n\n- Sophie Logan\n- Sophie Darr\n- Sophie Gibson\n- Jess Peck\n- Ronke Lawal\n- Surena Chande\n- Lauren Roitman\n- Dave Smart\n- Jamar Ramos\n- Clarissa Ankrah\n- Lucky Acan\n- Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence  \n- Olivia-Mae Foong\n- Lucy Robinson\n- Petar Jovetic\n- Charlie Norledge\n- Dan Taylor\n- Daniel Liddle\n- Marco Giordano\n- Chloe Ivy Rose\n- Rejoice Ojiaku\n- Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis  \n\nAnd loads of other people I've not mentioned who have made my fourth year as an SEO a great one.","src/content/posts/fourth-year-professional-seo.md","80b5d26be93e20fe",{"html":3287,"metadata":3288},"\u003Cp>Today marks the fourth anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (\u003Ca href=\"/posts/first-year-professional-seo/\">read about my first year\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/posts/second-year-professional-seo/\">my second year\u003C/a>), and \u003Ca href=\"/posts/third-year-professional-seo/\">my third year\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here is what I’ve learnt in my fourth year as a professional.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"people\">People\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-seos-still-love-experts-even-when-they-pass-off-second-hand-information\">1.

The year 2000 to be exact.\n\n## Web 1.0\n\nI was living in Atlanta at the time as my dad had got a teaching job out there. While we only lasted 6 months out there, it was the start of my obsession with the Web. My mum worked at my school library a few times a week and every Wednesday, I'd stay after school for a couple of hours and spend my time in the library. Amongst the shelves of books were a few rows of computers and I'd basically fall down Web-bit holes, exploring everything the Internet had to offer. When we moved back to the UK, I got myself a Yahoo! email address and consolidated my preferences for their search engine over Google (even Ask Jeeves took precedence!). I also discovered that you could make your own website, thrusting me into the world of web development.\n\nIt was all about Tripod and Homestead for Web hosting, Geocities, FrontPage Express (the free version of Microsoft Frontpage), and lots of HTML. I'd use my dad's work laptop to code my site after spending 20 minutes plucking up the courage to ask. I never finished a site but it was so fun that I didn't care.\n\nEventually, I matured and moved onto Dreamweaver, more sustainable Web hosting, and then a myriad of different frameworks and environments. It was mostly HTML and, now, CSS. Building stuff from scratch. There was no \"responsiveness\" back then. I avoided Flash like the plague but thought \"[slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing_(interface_design))\" was the most amazing thing that I just couldn't pull off. And absolutely no JavaScript, yuck!\n\n## My start as an Astro-naut\n\nFast forward to 2021 and by then, I was on the tenth iteration of my personal site and I'd started working for my current employer as an SEO Executive. I was using Grav at the time and enjoying it, although I didn't get on with its templating language, Twig (with hindsight, I get it now). I'd even tried Jekyll for a bit when I got obsessed with the idea of linkblogs and [Monica Dinculescu's website](https://meowni.ca/) (which remains a stylistic inspiration for this one).\n\nThen I found Astro, this new framework that promised \u003Cq cite=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/\">faster websites with less client-side Javascript\u003C/q>. I'd just started getting into Web performance so this piqued my interest. I was comfortable enough Terminal and running builds to get behind how Astro worked. So I took the plunge.\n\nLemme tell ya: those first few months were \u003Cspan style=\"color:#fc1420;\">**_hell_**\u003C/span>.\n\nI spent hours and hours trying to get things working. The truth was, while there was less client-side JavaScript&mdash;with it being a static site generator&mdash;there was MORE JavaScript in the backend for me. I'd been used to hard-coding everything but Astro gave me the opportunity to create stuff dynamically. Go to my homepage and you'll see a little greeting in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. That's static now but in the pre-build code, it's JavaScript. At least that was simple.\n\n## Persistence paid off... until it didn't... and then it did again\n\nAll those nights troubleshooting until 3am paid off in the end. I'd joined the Discord, became engaged, asked for help, and got what I needed to that point. But with more updates came new features. [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) were introduced with Astro 2.0. These allowed for better management of content in an Astro project if you had, say, a blog or newsletter, or wanted to consolidate authors. The problem was that I'd set everything up without this and the thought of refactoring everything gave me a headache, so I abstained for a while.\n\nThe idea of lagging behind didn't sit well with me though and I rolled up my proverbial sleeves and gave it a go. Thanks to the documentation and not caring much about the URL changes (post > posts, oh no what would Google do???), I pulled through and have since built the collections out with more sections. Easy peasy...\n\n...no really. That was it. My woes were over (well, apart from reducing some of the bloat from my node modules folder which briefly broke everything but it all got fixed)\n\nI did have one more dragon to slay though: JavaScript.\n\n## How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love JavaScript\n\nWorking in technical SEO means exposure to JavaScript, either directly through JavaScript SEO or realising that web devs use it way too much and... let me not digress. I'd tried learning multiple times in the past and couldn't get my head around it all. It all felt too much like C++ which I'd tried and failed with during the computer science degree I dropped out of in 2008.\n\nBut if you've got this far, you'll know I don't let something get me down for too long when it comes to learning. I started up my web development course again on Udemy and went through everything from the beginning. I was well versed in Python already so most of the basics were the same but I didn't want to skip over anything. Eventually, I got the hang of the easy stuff and got to grips with event handlers (love those things), figured out what maps did after using them without prior knowledge. Everything was clicking and I had Astro to thank for setting me on the path.\n\n## Would I recommend Astro?\n\nHell yeah I would.

With my credentials, I wrote a script that scraped the data and created a JSON file out of it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport datetime\n\npayload = {\n  'api_key': API_KEY,\n  'format': 'json',\n  'limit': 1000,\n}\n\nr = requests.get('https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.gettopartists&user=USERNAME', params=payload)\n\nres = r.json()\n\nfor key in range(0,len(res['topartists']['artist'])):\n    \n    # Change playCount from str to int\n    res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'] = int(res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'])\n\n    res['last updated'] = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%d %B %Y')\n\nwith open('../data/lastfm.json', \"w+\") as f:\n    json.dump(res, f, indent=4)\n```\n\nThis created a \u003Ccode>lastfm.json\u003C/code> file. I also included a key for the date when I update the file so I can display that on the page. Now there's time to use the Fetch API.\n\n## 2. Fetch the data\n\nI use the Fetch API for my wiki pages to pull data from my other WordPress blogs via the REST API. In this case, I'm pulling from a local JSON file so I start by importing the file:\n\n```javascript\nimport lastfm from '../data/lastfm.json';\n```\n\nThen I use .map() to map the rank, artist, and playcount to a table.\n\n```html\n\u003Cp>Last updated: {lastfm['last updated']}\u003C/p>\n  \u003Ctable>\n    \u003Cthead>\n      \u003Ctr>\n        \u003Cth>Pos.\u003C/th>\n        \u003Cth>Artist\u003C/th>\n        \u003Cth>Playcount\u003C/th>\n      \u003C/tr>\n    \u003C/thead>\n  {lastfm.topartists.artist.map((item) => (\n    \u003Ctr>\n      \u003Ctd>{item['@attr'].rank}\u003C/td>\n      \u003Ctd>\u003Ca href={item.url}>{item.name}\u003C/a>\u003C/td>\n      \u003Ctd>{item.playcount.toLocaleString()}\u003C/td>\n    \u003C/tr>\n  ))}\n  \u003C/table>\n```\n\nA couple of things to note: \u003Ccode>lastfm.topartists.artist.map\u003C/code> gets all the artist data and \u003Ccode>item.playcount.toLocaleString()\u003C/code> converts the playcount and adds a thousands comma seperator.\n\nAnd that's it.

It doesn't matter what it is or who it's for as long as it is absorbed and engagement is exchanged. It's grey, it's tasteless, and it fills a void that it also creates. Sounds dystopian, doesn't it? A bit Matrix-y. Over the top? Harsh? Perhaps. But that's not an insult to all creatives or people who call themselves content creators. I watch a lot of people who class themselves as that and I enjoy their work. But I can tell the difference between someone who puts their heart and soul into their creations and someone like Mr.Beast who churns shit out for shit's sake.\n\nAnd that's why I say I'm not a content creator. No matter who engages with my work, whether it's new music, my blogs, social media posts, newsletter updates, or this website, I know I've given it my all and I've tried to tell a story based on my life experiences. It might seem like I churn out music because I release new albums every other month but I just work that fast and I craft things quickly and in a way that makes me feel good and expresses my feelings at the time. I blog the same way. I post the same way. I build this site the same wa— actually, I take a little longer with that but you get the idea. I can't deny these viral videos take effort and planning because I know they do.

No one is truly better than anyone else. The numbers might mean something to them but we're all getting the same thing and it's all about who sees what more than the other.\n\nSo to the people who make \"good content\", I say no—you don't make content at all.

An old friend gave me a cracked copy of Logic Pro 8 which I used before I upgraded to [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) and rode that train for the next 10 years. Most of my discography was made on Logic and it worked super well for me. I'd heard of [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) but didn't want to move away from what I knew because it worked.\n\nBut in 2020, I felt that I needed to try something different and my aversion to Ableton was having to learn a new piece of technology to make music. I'd been in a creative rut for 3 years between 2015–2018 and I worried that the frustration of a new DAW (digital audio workstation) made me anxious. But what better time to get to grips with something than during a global pandemic?\n\nSo, with the free copy of Ableton Live Lite 10 that came with my [Novation Launchkey Mini MKII](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Novation-Launchkey-Mini-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B00VVNOMGI?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&linkId=63b05a1bb4d1b7a98ffe8140f37c311c&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (affiliate link), I took the plunge and while it took a few weeks to get used to, I got the hang of it. And in that year, I made one of my best albums ever called [Justice&Peace](https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/justice-peace). My favourite part of Ableton was the sample manipulation. Time and pitch stretching were so much better compared to Logic as the sample quality never felt like it was deteriorating if I made it super slow or drop the pitch right down. And so many features to try out.\n\n4 years later and I've since upgraded to Ableton Lite Intro and I'm part of the beta program (12 is coming soon, folks!) and those features? I've barely added any new ones to my repertoire since I started in 2020. I've watched videos by some amazing musicians who use Ableton and thought their dexterity for the software was sublime. But you know what? I'm actually okay with my simple setup.\n\nI have a lot of gear that I hardly use, mainly because I don't have a fixed setup—a lot of my music is made in or on my bed still. Sometimes, I'll take it to my work desk but it's usually just my laptop or I include my Launchkey Mini into the mix (no pun intended). But I have a template that loads up every time I open Ableton:\n\n* 4 tracks of audio\n* 3 tracks for the kick, snare, and hi-hat\n* 1 track for vocal samples (woos and yeahs, that kinda thing)\n* My mastering chain with a limiter and basic EQing\n\nI have a ton of drum samples, both downloaded and via [Splice](https://splice.com/). I use as many different ones as I can and sample sample sample. My workflow involves churning beat drafts out and coming back to them later to mold them into proper beats. Having a basic foundation caters to that. I know if I had lots going on from the start, I'd be overwhelmed and wouldn't get things done. But having the option to build on top of what I have *if I want to* is essential.\n\nSo if you've reached this far and have felt like Ableton is overwhelming or you're worried that you're not doing enough with what you have, I say: you're doing just fine. Make a template like mine with enough of what you need to get started and finish with and have fun. Add components if you want. Or don't. But don't feel bad that you've not got the latest plugin or drum sounds or anything from Max. Fancy shit isn't a prerequisite for quality. But making shit is.","src/content/posts/i-dont-use-all-features-ableton-thats-okay.md","de1c111c2aa3e0f1",{"html":3647,"metadata":3648},"\u003Cp>I wasn’t sure whether to write this but maybe it’ll help reassure someone who needs to hear it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I started making music in 2010 while I was studying for a degree in Music Technology.

But I have a template that loads up every time I open Ableton:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>4 tracks of audio\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>3 tracks for the kick, snare, and hi-hat\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>1 track for vocal samples (woos and yeahs, that kinda thing)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>My mastering chain with a limiter and basic EQing\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>I have a ton of drum samples, both downloaded and via \u003Ca href=\"https://splice.com/\">Splice\u003C/a>. I use as many different ones as I can and sample sample sample. My workflow involves churning beat drafts out and coming back to them later to mold them into proper beats. Having a basic foundation caters to that. I know if I had lots going on from the start, I’d be overwhelmed and wouldn’t get things done. But having the option to build on top of what I have \u003Cem>if I want to\u003C/em> is essential.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you’ve reached this far and have felt like Ableton is overwhelming or you’re worried that you’re not doing enough with what you have, I say: you’re doing just fine. Make a template like mine with enough of what you need to get started and finish with and have fun. Add components if you want. Or don’t. But don’t feel bad that you’ve not got the latest plugin or drum sounds or anything from Max. Fancy shit isn’t a prerequisite for quality.

Whether it be for his impeccable choice of samples through a multitude of different styles, his uncanny knack of blowing your mind with his musicianship or his humility in a sea of egos and gold chains, he is revered as a legend beyond the realms of hip-hop music, and rightfully so. But perhaps something that he doesn’t get enough credit for, publicly at least, is his drumming techniques, both acoustic and digital. The Detroit producer was mean on the MPC but his live drumming had influences on a number of his peers, particularly Questlove and Kariem Riggins, who have since helped carry his legacy on.\n\nThe story goes that Amp Fiddler, a fellow Detroitian, was the man who gave Dilla his first MPC. It had a minor fault and no manual at hand, but he found a way to get it working and the rest is hip-hop history. From there, he improved his craft and soon surpassed his main idols—Pete Rock and DJ Premier. At Dilla’s wake, Pete Rock remaked that he used to be the king but Dilla had taken the crown soon after. His technique started similarly to his peers of the time. The early ’90s gave birth to “jazz rap” and the complementing drum breaks that came with it, thanks to Prince Paul and A Tribe Called Quest. By 1993, Tribe and co. had moved onto free drumming, in the pocket, classic boom bap.\n\nWhen it came time for Dilla to show what he had to offer on a major stage for The Pharcyde, it was 1995 and a year after what is known by fans as the “Second Golden Age” period of 1993-1994. “Runnin’” heralded the start of an illustrious career. Producing under the name “Jay Dee,” his music triggered the attention of Q-Tip and he managed to acquire his services for Tribe’s final two albums. Despite the internal strife Tribe were experiencing, Jay Dee, now performing under the collective name of The Ummah, let his music do the talking. Unlike the drum programming on Labcabincalifornia, the patterns on Beats, Rhymes & Life and The Love Movement were a lot looser, slightly off time at moments. This apparent “sloppiness” was no accident, however. Jay was playing it human. Allowing the kicks and snares to be slightly out of time moved the percussion aware from a machine feel and gave added weight to the swing and soul of the music. The two albums he featured on weren’t met with the same acclaim as the first three Tribe albums but that was more due to the ongoing strife between Tip and Phife as opposed to Jay Dee’s production quality.\n\nQuestlove once told XXL Magazine a story of how Dilla had used a beaten up drum kit on the Donald Byrd cover “Think Twice” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla had used a vibraphone mallet and a broken drumstick with toilet paper and rubber bands wrapped around it because he didn’t know where to get proper drumsticks late at night. His reasoning for using a mallet was to keep the dynamic less aggressive. Questlove subsequently went out and bought orchestra mallets and tried it out when he had to fly out to Philly. Even before that time, Dilla had been instrumental (pun intended) in the rhythmic and percussive elements of D’Angelo’s Voodoo (although not officially credited), pushing the human element of the drum programming all the way. Questlove clearly learnt a lot from this approach as his performances on the opener “Playa Playa,” for example, exhibits the funky swing of the rimshot against the booming bass drum to give a distinct sound that permeated throughout the whole album. As Quest said himself, “The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.” Talking to Okayplayer, Quest remarked that “Word Play” on Tribe’s Beats, Rhymes & Life singlehandedly changed his thinking towards drumming, because of the sloppiness of the kick, executed with “finesse and defiance.“ Looking at where he is right now in terms of success, that was a pretty big influence.\n\nBy the time Dilla’s second “era” came around, the gritty street feel mixed with the brief beginnings of his electro phase, Karriem Riggins had already known the Detroit producer for five years, having met him through Common in ’96. In that time, he had provided his drumming expertise on “2 U 4 U” and later produced “The Clapper” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla’s influence on Riggins was as profound, maybe more so after the release of his debut album, Alone/Together, which featured the track “J Dilla The Greatest.” “I learned different ways to get certain feels out of the machine, to basically convey an idea,” he told XXL Mag. “Turning the time shifting off and playing the track live. I think his approach was different every time.” Riggins illustrated the point further in a video with Peanut Butter Wolf and J.Rocc. Using the machine, be it a MPC or one of the newer Maschines, as a tool rather than the music maker allowed for more human flexibility in production.\n\nAsk most producers right now some of their main influences and you’ll hear Dilla’s name mentioned pretty much every time. The reason behind this may differ from musician to musician but the general crux of it comes from his approach to the whole process, from start to finish. There’s also an element of curiosity; what sample did he use on that cut, how did he get the snare to sound like that without it being too brash? Video series like Waajeed’s “Bling47 Breaks Dilla Edition” answered some of those burning questions with the purpose to demystify Dilla and his production, according to Waajeed himself. Jazz drummer Damion Reid, talking to NPR Music, expressed his admiration for Dilla’s ability to encompass every element within his compositions, “every drum, every nuance, every atmospheric sound was strategically placed. Jay Dee embodied, to me, the culmination of all those things.” Last year, ERIMAJ released his debut album Conflict Of A Man and featured his take on Dilla’s “Nothing Like This,” one of his most enigmatic works. Drummer/producer Jamire Williams captured the essence of the original, the arena anthem percussion, while adapting it to cater to his own style with the added Rhodes and guitar.\n\nThe sheer number of drummers and drummers-turned-producers with some connection to Dilla through direct communication or a mutual stylistic respect is mind boggling.

As I learn by doing, I've decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn't sure whether to do it as it's very niche to me but I've taken a step out of my comfort zone.\n\n[GitHub link to RALTS repository](https://github.com/lukedavisseo/ralts)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n1.

[Summary](#summary)\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ralts\"> What is RALTS?\u003C/h2>\n\nRALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it's a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I'll explain those all in more detail later.\n\nThere is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I'll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.\n\nExamples:\n\n* https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema\n* https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow\n* https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry\n* https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring\n* https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs\n\nIn terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I'm a Pokémon fan. It's a backronym but it works for me.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why_did_you_make_this\">Why did I make it?\u003C/h2>\n\ntl;dr: it aids my blogging process.\n\nI love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I'm a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).\n\nFundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn't think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"notes_on_my_coding\">Notes on my coding\u003C/h2>\n\nBefore I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I've only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I've done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven't finished. You'll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for \"stupid code\" and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).\n\nI also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his zero shot demo. He wrote a great piece on [zero shot learning](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) which you should read if you're interested.\n\n[There's also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joeddav/zero-shot-demo).\n\nIf I've taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I've forgotten to credit or if you'd prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"some_definitions\">Some definitions\u003C/h2>\n\nSo, about that original explanation. Let's look at some definitions:\n\n* Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.\n\n* Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \"an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\".\n\n* Categories - The term \"categories\" is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising\n\n* Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.\n\n* Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They're basically like tags.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tech_requirements\">Tech requirements\u003C/h2>\n\nThese are the following Python packages used in the script:\n\n```\nstreamlit>=1.0.0\npandas>=1.2.3\ntransformers>=4.12.3\nrequests>=2.25.1\nbs4>=0.0.1\nplotly>=5.4.0\nnumpy>=1.18.0\ntextrazor==1.4.0\ntensorflow>=2.7.0\n```\n\n[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for the language model, requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for web scraping, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data viz, [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) for the entities and such, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the language model.\n\nRegarding TensorFlow, the language model I'm using is called [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the_code\">The code\u003C/h2>\n\nThe code is split into different parts:\n\n### 1. TextRazor API key and client details\n\n```python\n# TextRazor details\ntextrazor.api_key = API_KEY\n\nclient = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=[\"entities\", \"topics\"])\nclient.set_classifiers([\"textrazor_newscodes\"])\n```\n\nWe set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to `textrazor_newscodes`. [Find out more on TextRazor's Classification page](https://www.textrazor.com/classification).\n\n### 2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping\n\n```python\n# Load model\n@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)\ndef load_model():\n  return pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\", \n  model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9', \n  multi_label=True)\n\n# Classification function\ndef classify(sequences, candidate_labels):\n  output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,\n    candidate_labels=candidate_labels)\n  return output_results['labels'], output_results['scores']\n\n# Graph plot function\ndef plot_result(top_topics, scores):\n  top_topics = np.array(top_topics)\n  scores = np.array(scores)\n  scores *= 100\n  fig = px.bar(x=scores, \n    y=top_topics,\n    orientation='h', \n    labels={'x': 'Confidence', 'y': 'Label'},\n    text=scores,\n    range_x=(0,115),\n    title='Top Predictions',\n    color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),\n    color_continuous_scale='GnBu')\n  fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)\n  fig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:0.1f}%',\n  textposition='outside')\n  st.plotly_chart(fig)\n\ndef req(url):\n  resp = requests.get(url)\n  soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')\n  if soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\") or soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\"):\n    remove_comments = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\")\n    remove_comments.extract()\n    remove_secondary = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\")\n    remove_secondary.extract()\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n  else:\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n  with st.spinner('Classifying...'):\n    global txt\n    df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)\n    df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(\n      by='Relevance Score', ascending=False)\n    classify_topic_score = list(\n      df_classify_topic['Topic'][:10])\n    if input_type == 'Text':\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'URL':\n      txt = req(url)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n      txt = ' '.join(all_txt)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n\n  plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])\n```\n\nThere's a lot here so I'll break it down further.\n\nThe first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn't reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.\n\nThe second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.\n\nThe third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.\n\nHere's how the model classified this blog post:\n\n![A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score](/images/classification-labels.jpg)\n\nThe fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars ([thanks to Jess for the help with that](https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604)) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.\n\nThe fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.\n\n### 3. Dictionaries\n\n```python\nkw_dict = {\n  'Keyword': []\n}\n\nent_dict = {\n  'Keyword': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ntopics_dict = {\n  'Topic': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ncategories_dict = {\n  'Category': [],\n  'Relevance Score': []\n}\n\ntags = {\n  'Tag': [],\n  'ID': [],\n  'Count': []\n}\n```\n\nArguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.\n\n### 4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists\n\n```python\n# Blog list\nblogs = ['sampleface.co.uk',\n\t'cultrface.co.uk',\n\t'logicface.co.uk',\n\t'playrface.co.uk',\n\t'distantarcade.co.uk']\n\n# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs\nexisting_tags = []\nall_txt = []\n\n# Upper limits for tag page range\nupper_limits = {\n  'sampleface.co.uk': 4,\n  'cultrface.co.uk': 4,\n  'logicface.co.uk': 2,\n  'playrface.co.uk': 2,\n  'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,\n  'ld89.org': 1\n}\n```\n\nHere, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.\n\nThe tag data comes from WordPress's REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).\n\nAlso, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)\n\n### 5. The Streamlit UI stuff\n\n```python\n# Streamlit stuff\n\nst.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')\n\ninput_type = st.sidebar.radio(\n\t'Select your input type',\n\t['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])\n\nupdate_tags = st.sidebar.button('↻ Refresh tags')\n\ntag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')\n\n\n# Determines input types\nst.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')\nst.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')\nif input_type == 'Text':\n  txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')\n  txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('\"', '').replace('“','').replace('”', '').replace('‘','').replace('’', '').replace(\"'s\", '').replace(\",\", '')\n  st.write(len(txt))\nelif input_type == 'URL':\n  url = st.text_input('Enter URL')\nelif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n  multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')\n```\n\nThis displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.\n\n### 6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress's REST API\n\n```python\ndef update_all_tags():\n\n  with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):\n\n    for blog in blogs:\n    \n      # Get tag data\n      for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):\n\n        tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'\n        r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)\n        api_tags = r_tag.json()\n\n        for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):\n          tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])\n          tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])\n          tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])\n\n        with open(f\"{blog}.json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n          json.dump(tags, outfile)\n      tags['Tag'] = []\n      tags['ID'] = []\n      tags['Count'] = []\n\nlist_of_blogs = st.radio(\"Select the corresponding blog\", blogs)\n\n# Load JSON files\nwith open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:\n  blog_json = json.load(f)\n  x = blog_json['Tag']\n  for n in x:\n    existing_tags.append(n)\n\nsubmit = st.button('Submit')\n\nif update_tags:\n  update_all_tags()\n```\n\nThere are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won't change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.\n\nFrom there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.\n\n### 7. The random functions for content ideas\n\n```python\n# Tag ideas functions\n\ndef sf_words():\n\n\twith open(\"sampleface.co.uk.json\") as sf_json_file:\n\t\tsf = json.load(sf_json_file)\n\tsf_words_lists = sf['Tag']\n\treturn sf_words_lists\n\ndef cultr_words():\n\n\twith open(\"cultrface.co.uk.json\") as cf_json_file:\n\t\tcf = json.load(cf_json_file)\n\tcf_words_lists = cf['Tag']\n\treturn cf_words_lists\n\ndef logic_words():\n\n\twith open(\"logicface.co.uk.json\") as lf_json_file:\n\t\tlf = json.load(lf_json_file)\n\tlf_words_lists = lf['Tag']\n\treturn lf_words_lists\n\ndef playr_words():\n\n\twith open(\"playrface.co.uk.json\") as pf_json_file:\n\t\tpf = json.load(pf_json_file)\n\tpf_words_lists = pf['Tag']\n\treturn pf_words_lists\n\ndef da_words():\n\n\twith open(\"distantarcade.co.uk.json\") as da_json_file:\n\t\tda = json.load(da_json_file)\n\tda_words_lists = da['Tag']\n\treturn da_words_lists\n\nall_words_list = [sf_words(), cultr_words(), logic_words(), playr_words(), da_words()]\n\ndef sampleface():\n\n\tst.header('Sampleface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"sampleface.co.uk.json\") as sf_json_file:\n\t\t\tsf = json.load(sf_json_file)\n\t\tsf_words_count_lists = sf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in sf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t\t# sf_choices = random.choices(sf_words_count_lists, weights=(1/n), k=2)\n\t\tsample = random.choices(sf_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\t\ndef cultrface():\n\n\tst.header('Cultrface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"cultrface.co.uk.json\") as cf_json_file:\n\t\t\tcf = json.load(cf_json_file)\n\t\tcf_words_count_lists = cf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in cf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t\t# sf_choices = random.choices(sf_words_count_lists, weights=(1/n), k=2)\n\t\tsample = random.choices(cultr_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef logicface():\n\n\tst.header('LOGiCFACE ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"logicface.co.uk.json\") as lf_json_file:\n\t\t\tlf = json.load(lf_json_file)\n\t\tlf_words_count_lists = lf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in lf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(logic_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef playrface():\n\n\tst.header('Playrface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"playrface.co.uk.json\") as pf_json_file:\n\t\t\tpf = json.load(pf_json_file)\n\t\tpf_words_count_lists = pf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in pf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(playr_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef distantarcade():\n\n\tst.header('Distant Arcade ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"distantarcade.co.uk.json\") as da_json_file:\n\t\t\tda = json.load(da_json_file)\n\t\tda_words_count_lists = da['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in da_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(da_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef all_blogs():\n\n\tsampleface()\n\tcultrface()\n\tlogicface()\n\tplayrface()\n\tdistantarcade()\n```\n\nI'll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs' tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags' counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.\n\nFinally, they're all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.\n\n### 8.

I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it'll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It's worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!\n\n### 9.

The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I've used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.\n\nBelow is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Keyword     \t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score | Existing tag |\n| -----------------------------\t| --------------- | ------------ |\n| Website      \t\t\t\t\t| 0.6620       \t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Search engine optimization    | 0.6460          | 0\t\t\t |\n| Web scraping\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6450\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| World Wide Website\t\t\t| 0.6440\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| HTML\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6320\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n\nA table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Topic     \t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score | Existing tag |\n| -----------------------------\t| --------------- | ------------ |\n| API      \t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000       \t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Blog    \t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000          | 0\t\t\t |\n| Computer science\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 1\t\t\t |\n| Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Google Search\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n\nAnd a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Category     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score |\n| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\t| --------------- |\n| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology      \t\t| 0.8100\t\t  | \n| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology>software  \t| 0.7330\t\t  |\n| arts, culture and entertainment>internet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6020\t\t  |\n| arts, culture and entertainment>language\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.5620\t\t  |\n| science and technology>engineering\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.5360\t\t  |\n\n### 10.

This isn't fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.\n\nThere are also no means of downloading the outputted data.

Let’s look at some definitions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has “an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction”.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Categories - The term “categories” is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically.

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won’t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files.

Some would say this pretty much sums up the whole album, or even the whole outfit, but I’d draw the line there. It’s been five years since their last one (Dynamite, for those who’ve forgotten or just didn’t know). There are elements from that album that have transfused into this one, but the main omission is the electronic vibe; this one dons its cap at the early years. Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai’s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.\n\nWhat I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?\n\nSo here’s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.\n\n## 1. Rock Dust Light Star\n\nThe title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn’t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I’m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you’re a new listener, but won’t blow you away.\n\n**Similar song**: Couldn’t really think of one.\n\n**Rating**: 6/10\n\n## 2. White Knuckle Ride\n\nIt’s funk, it’s house, it’s “high-octane”, it’s Jamiroquai. If it wasn’t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It’s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: “Pressure, it’s not so easy to control”. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.\n\n**Similar song**: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 3. Smoke and Mirrors\n\nSomeone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn’t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It’s a welcome return and it’s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.\n\n**Similar song**: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 4. All Good In The Hood\n\nI remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn’t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn’t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&B (separate rant for a separate day).\n\n**Similar song**:  Soul Education from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 5. Hurtin’\n\nThis track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he’s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it’s their second full foray into a genre they’ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I’ll leave that question up to you, folks.\n\n**Similar song**: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 6. Blue Skies\n\nWhat… a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can’t be right. Well it is. And it’s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I’ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren’t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I’ve heard people say “they sing the same stuff over and over” to which I’d reply “yeah, because they’re a funk band. You don’t say that about James Brown, do you?”. I haven’t said that yet, but I will one day. It’s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it’d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it’s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn’t. It’s a shame because it’s definitely a radio favourite.\n\n**Similar song**: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 7. Lifeline\n\nThere seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It’s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we’d break up. That never happened). It’s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.\n\n**Similar song**: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 8. She’s a Fast Persuader\n\nThis. Song. Rocks. My. Socks. Into. Space. I’m getting goosebumps just from writing about it. I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I’m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing, an instrumental that didn’t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass… eargasmic. It’s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.\n\n**Similar song**: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey\n\n**Rating**: 10/10\n\n## 9. Two Completely Different Things\n\nJay Kay says it’s from Synkronized, Matt Johnson says it’s from Dynamite. It has elements of both albums but I’d probably side with Matt on this one. It’s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it’d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.\n\n**Similar song**: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 10. Goodbye To My Dancer\n\nAnother title that had me laughing and scratching my head (this time I actually acted on my thoughts, but still didn’t laugh out loud) but I needn’t. For me, it’s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!). It has a African/Latin kind of feel, which could be an overflow from the previous track and it works.\n\n**Similar song**: Can’t think, feel free to help me out here\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 11. Never Gonna Be Another\n\nThis one almost copies the chords from the previous tracks and adds to the melancholy. It’s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it’s a good break up song if you’re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you’re not 14 anymore).\n\n**Similar song**: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 6.5/10\n\n## 12. Hey Floyd\n\nNow this is how you finish an album. Grand, majestic and multi-layered. It’d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who’s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn’t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\n\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI’ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn’t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n> “That Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.”\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he’s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it’s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I’m digressing from the main point.\n\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It’s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it’s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They’re behaving more like an indie band, which I don’t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn’t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It’s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it’s going to be a white knuckle ride.\n\n**Final rating**: 8/10","src/content/posts/jamiroquai-rock-dust-light-star-review.md","f42b783fc55ef5f8",{"html":3793,"metadata":3794},"\u003Ch2 id=\"here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better\">“Here it is, there’s no way to make it better.”\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai’s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star.

It’s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it’s going to be a white knuckle ride.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Final rating\u003C/strong>: 8/10\u003C/p>",{"headings":3795,"imagePaths":3838,"frontmatter":3839},[3796,3799,3802,3805,3808,3811,3814,3817,3820,3823,3826,3829,3832,3835],{"depth":200,"slug":3797,"text":3798},"here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better","“Here it is, there’s no way to make it better.”",{"depth":200,"slug":3800,"text":3801},"1-rock-dust-light-star","1.

Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo’s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\n\n## Act 1: Roger Federer\n\n![Roger Federer](/images/esq-roger-federer-wimbledon-2012-xlg.jpeg)\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change – most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many – and he’s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn’t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer’s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn’t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\n\nBut 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\n\nFor me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn’t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I’d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It’s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\n\n## Act 2: J Dilla\n\n![J Dilla](/images/dilla.jpeg)\n\nMy hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn’t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres – hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica – and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\n\nBy now, I’d discovered he’d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to [Donuts](https://sampleface.co.uk/28-days-of-dilla-28-j-dilla-donuts/), didn’t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\n\n## Act 3: Union and Victory\n\n![Roger Federer, Wimbledon Champion 2012](/images/Roger-Federer-Wimbledon-Champion-2012_2792722.jpeg)\n\nBut how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla’s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer’s and Murray’s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn’t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn’t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles’ Hard Day’s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\n\nThe Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. “I knew it”, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad’s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\n\n## Reprise\n\n![J Dilla's basement](/images/4dilla.jpeg)\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won’t be leaving the sport completely.\n\nAs for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best “disciples” is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla’s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I’ve been rinsing out for years, the “newer” stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.","src/content/posts/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend.md","165156035d84fa68",{"html":3939,"metadata":3940},"\u003Cp>I’m proud of this essay; it’s the only one of its kind.

Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-1-roger-federer\">Act 1: Roger Federer\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/esq-roger-federer-wimbledon-2012-xlg.jpeg\" alt=\"Roger Federer\">\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change – most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many – and he’s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn’t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer’s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn’t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn’t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I’d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It’s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-2-j-dilla\">Act 2: J Dilla\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/dilla.jpeg\" alt=\"J Dilla\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn’t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres – hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica – and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By now, I’d discovered he’d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to \u003Ca href=\"https://sampleface.co.uk/28-days-of-dilla-28-j-dilla-donuts/\">Donuts\u003C/a>, didn’t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-3-union-and-victory\">Act 3: Union and Victory\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Roger-Federer-Wimbledon-Champion-2012_2792722.jpeg\" alt=\"Roger Federer, Wimbledon Champion 2012\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla’s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer’s and Murray’s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn’t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn’t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles’ Hard Day’s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. “I knew it”, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad’s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"reprise\">Reprise\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/4dilla.jpeg\" alt=\"J Dilla&#x27;s basement\">\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won’t be leaving the sport completely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others. One of his best “disciples” is Black Milk and unlike many among him, he has found his own sound that stands tall alongside Dilla’s. That is where the best results of inspiration arise. Unreleased content pops up every few months thanks to Ma Dukes and the Foundation and while some are the bootlegs I’ve been rinsing out for years, the “newer” stuff is just as incredible as if they were made in 2016. There will never be another producer like J Dilla. His constant reinvention was aspirational, his music ethereal, his vision unparalleled. They may never have crossed paths in real life but in my mind, they were two peas from the same pod. Or two bites from the same donut.\u003C/p>",{"headings":3941,"imagePaths":3954,"frontmatter":3955},[3942,3945,3948,3951],{"depth":200,"slug":3943,"text":3944},"act-1-roger-federer","Act 1: Roger Federer",{"depth":200,"slug":3946,"text":3947},"act-2-j-dilla","Act 2: J Dilla",{"depth":200,"slug":3949,"text":3950},"act-3-union-and-victory","Act 3: Union and Victory",{"depth":200,"slug":3952,"text":3953},"reprise","Reprise",[],{"title":3931,"description":3932,"pubDate":3956,"tags":3957},"17 Dec 2016",[191,19,1938,553],"last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend.md","khruangbin-and-federer",{"id":3959,"data":3961,"body":3966,"filePath":3967,"digest":3968,"rendered":3969,"legacyId":3977},{"title":3962,"description":3963,"published":16,"tags":3964,"pubDate":3965},"Khruangbin & Federer","Two of my favourite things in the world: a great band and a great athlete.",[1938,191,553],["Date","2018-06-11T23:00:00.000Z"],"I did a Twitter poll for suggestions on what to do tonight and \"write something\" won out so here I am.\n\nThis post will be about two things.

After Nadal's \"supernatural\" 11th Roland Garros title win on Sunday, attention lies back with the World #2 Roger Federer as he aims to grab his #1 spot back and retain his Wimbledon title. He's in Stuttgart for the Mercedes Cup this week and should he reach the final, he'll be back on top for his 310th week. But I'm worried he won't emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players \"fall back\" on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I'm probably being premature as I've not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I'm unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he's 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible. Ultimately, he's past the moment he should be dominant so I'm trying to be grateful he's even playing, let alone defending [grand slam titles](/posts/roger-federer-numbers-game/).\n\nSo, to conclude.

I've been hyped for Sonic 3 since the end of Sonic 2 and I was not disappointed. Sure, the pacing at the start was off and there were some flaws in the film but the latter two thirds of the film were amazing and hit me in all the right places.

But my friend Andrew recommended Tetris Forever and I enjoyed it.

It had me so invested, as did all his previous books. I loved the characters and how they warmed to each other and the yearning and soft, encouraging ending was lovely.\n\n## Series of the year: One Day\n\nAnother work by David Nicholl. Based on my favourite book, this is the second live action rendition of One Day after the 2011 film starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. While I liked the film, it was missing some key parts and it didn't feel as close to the book as I wanted. But the series was so good. Every actor nailed their roles, especially Leo Woodall as Dexter Mayhew and Ambika Mod as Emma Morley. I laughed, I cried, I got engrossed in it all and watched some episodes multiple times just to feel something. I don't watch a lot of TV but this kept my attention.\n\n## Streamer of the year: Gronya\n\nFull disclosure: I have been a Twitch subscriber for the past few months and she used some of my music in one of her videos. With that said, I don't care how biased this looks: Gronya rocks. I found her YouTube channel earlier this year thanks to her efforts in helping to preserve the Dragon Quest VII DLC maps before the Nintendo eShop shut down. And then I watched some more videos. And then I reached out with my Dragon Quest-themed album and was surprised that I got a response and that she loved it. And then I found her Twitch channel and the rest is history.\n\nBut enough about me.

And that's not to say it missed the mark in any way but HEAVY enveloped me somehow. I loved all the songs, separately and together, and they made me feel so many emotions. I listened to the album a lot during my trips to Nice visiting my parents and during the times I was traveling on the tram, it kept me company like a good friend.

Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.",[1756,19],["Date","2021-01-23T00:00:00.000Z"],"Is there a word for soul searching but for blogs? Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.\n\nI've been doing a lot of that lately because as my output has increased, so have my questions about why I blog at all. It's nothing new; I've asking myself why for nearly a decade. It started out as fun and then fear of no one reading but I carried on regardless because I knew _some_ people were.\n\nAnd now I know more do but I can't shake off the feeling despite my continuation. I think I've written at least one blog post every month since 2011 and, as I write this, I've realised that's 10 years. This opposes my generally reserved demeanour but perhaps it doesn't. After all, I'm more talkative in environments I feel comfortable in and a CMS backend is as cosy as they come for me.\n\nOn my journey, I found this 2018 article from Rohan Maitzen called [A Brief Return to Meta-Blogging](https://rohanmaitzen.com/2018/11/13/a-brief-return-to-meta-blogging/). I resonated the most with this part:\n\n> If you got into blogging because you wanted to write about what you were reading, read about what other people were reading, and have a bit of discussion in both directions, I think (though my experience may not be representative, as it always depends on particulars) you might not feel things have changed all that much, at least in the spirit of the exercise.\n\nThis was in reference to a change in the blogosphere that happened towards the late 00s, when the popular indie bloggers started getting jobs at corporate publications, they became more money/ad-driven, and the faux-liberalism drifted even further to the right. Suddenly, [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) about your experiences became rhetoric-pushing through the guise of journalism.\n\nThis, in turn, changed how readers perceived the remaining indie bloggers and their output in a general sense. And the blogosphere shrunk more as time went on. I joined it all in 2008 without knowing any of this (I did my due diligence and read old stuff from the likes of Jason Kottke and did my research so as this is second/third-hand information, I suggest you do the same and don't take my paraphrasing as gospel - even if my name is Luke!)\n\nBut back to the present day and the quote. That's exactly why I blog. I like to write about what I read, read about other people doing the same, and share my thoughts amongst it all.

Meta-meta-blogging will have to do for now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been doing a lot of that lately because as my output has increased, so have my questions about why I blog at all. It’s nothing new; I’ve asking myself why for nearly a decade. It started out as fun and then fear of no one reading but I carried on regardless because I knew \u003Cem>some\u003C/em> people were.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And now I know more do but I can’t shake off the feeling despite my continuation. I think I’ve written at least one blog post every month since 2011 and, as I write this, I’ve realised that’s 10 years. This opposes my generally reserved demeanour but perhaps it doesn’t. After all, I’m more talkative in environments I feel comfortable in and a CMS backend is as cosy as they come for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On my journey, I found this 2018 article from Rohan Maitzen called \u003Ca href=\"https://rohanmaitzen.com/2018/11/13/a-brief-return-to-meta-blogging/\">A Brief Return to Meta-Blogging\u003C/a>. I resonated the most with this part:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>If you got into blogging because you wanted to write about what you were reading, read about what other people were reading, and have a bit of discussion in both directions, I think (though my experience may not be representative, as it always depends on particulars) you might not feel things have changed all that much, at least in the spirit of the exercise.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>This was in reference to a change in the blogosphere that happened towards the late 00s, when the popular indie bloggers started getting jobs at corporate publications, they became more money/ad-driven, and the faux-liberalism drifted even further to the right. Suddenly, \u003Ca href=\"/jardim/blogging/\">blogging\u003C/a> about your experiences became rhetoric-pushing through the guise of journalism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This, in turn, changed how readers perceived the remaining indie bloggers and their output in a general sense. And the blogosphere shrunk more as time went on. I joined it all in 2008 without knowing any of this (I did my due diligence and read old stuff from the likes of Jason Kottke and did my research so as this is second/third-hand information, I suggest you do the same and don’t take my paraphrasing as gospel - even if my name is Luke!)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But back to the present day and the quote. That’s exactly why I blog. I like to write about what I read, read about other people doing the same, and share my thoughts amongst it all. SEO has played a varying part in all that but I think therefore I write. And, yes, the spirit remains because apparently the flame hasn’t died for about 10 years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I must admit, I do plug my Patreon in relation to this because all of this does cost me money (\u003Ca href=\"/posts/how-much-do-my-blogs-cost/\">and I discussed this last year\u003C/a>) but I don’t try to acquire Andrew Sullivan or Laurie Penny levels of income (or try to attain their intellectual level of garbage that garner the money).

I'm not much of a gamer either so it wasn't too difficult to make a list of my five favourites.\n\n## Pokémon Gold/Silver (GBC, 2000)\n\nI didn't think anything could surpass Red/Blue/Yellow and then this came along. I was living in Atlanta when it came out but the buildup was amazing. They had display Gameboy Colors in Target and Walmart and I spent so much time on them. The series introduced some important features that still hold true today: new regions, separation of Special into Special Attack and Special Defence, day and night, breeding, but most importantly, 100 new Pokémon. It has since been remade for the DS and will be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on 22nd September.\n\n## Championship Manager 01/02 (PC, 2001)\n\nI can't for the life of me get into Football Manager. 01/02 holds my heart. I play with updates from the real world as not to feel too archaic and it's the last great game before the change. It's thin on the ground for realistic features but thanks to some special patches, it's not so bad. Playing it vanilla and you get some legendary players who couldn't imitate their \"digital\" careers.\n\n## Super Mario World (SNES, 1990)\n\nOne of my favourite early childhood memories (see F-Zero and Sonic 2 below). I was lucky enough to play it on a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was the best thing in the world. Riding Yoshi was like nothing I had ever done before.\n\n## F-Zero (SNES, 1990)\n\nAnother fond childhood game. I only ever played this at my friend's house as he had a SNES and I wasn't allowed one. It's easily my favourite driving game. Incredible soundtrack, super addictive gameplay and then-state of the art graphics.\n\n## Sonic 2 (Sega Genesis, 1992)\n\nChristmas 1993. My cousins got this for their Sega Genesis. I got to play it and enjoyed every moment. I got to know Sonic before Mario (who I've played more of in my lifetime). It's an instant classic and includes good old Myles Prower.\n\n\u003Cem>Honorable mentions: Mario Tennis (N64), Pokémon Puzzle League (N64), Tetris (GB), Ronaldo V Football (GBC), System Shock 2 (PC), Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes (PC), Super RC Pro-Am (GB)\u003C/em>","src/content/posts/my-five-favourite-video-games-of-all-time.md","df3b9a010773c250",{"html":4186,"metadata":4187},"\u003Cp>Taken this from a \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/epicgeezr/status/891781690540118018\">viral tweet\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://kottke.org/17/08/my-five-favorite-video-games-of-all-time\">kottke.org\u003C/a>.

I own a Canon but I wouldn't say no to one of these.\n\n## Sony Cyber-shot\n\n![SONY Cyber-shot](/images/SONY_Cyber-shot_DSC_W530.jpg)\n\nAnother example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens.

It’s when you hold onto ideas without actually putting them into place and as they build up, you’re left with an increasing number of unfulfilled concepts. I suffer from this badly. In my late teens, I came up with an idea for a fantasy novel. Ten years later, I still have a “binder of lore”, along with another of my ideas – **_Hyperman_**, a superhero kept alive by radium gas (yes, that highly volatile, highly toxic gas). While the later was conjured from a bored Sunday afternoon and will never become anything more than a poor drawing, I’d love to make a go of the novel. But it’s not going to happen.

New ideas blossom pretty quickly in my head but soon take over like wild weeds. The negative connotations are on purpose; I become wrapped up and prioritise it over anything else, usually daily necessities like eating and cleaning. This wouldn’t sound so bad except my ideas **_never go further than my own outlets_**. For the music I make, I’ve been very lucky to make some money from it and received good feedback from my peers. Other than that, I get nothing other than momentary satisfaction. This adds interest to the Idea Debt but fortunately this is simple interest as it doesn’t hamper my creative desire for the next project.\n\nAs I sit here thinking of all the ideas I’ve ever had and a debt that won’t go away, I wonder what would happen if I just set them free. Would one of those creative buds be better suited with someone else? I’d like to think so. As a species, we are very clingy to the products of our thoughts. We’re afraid to share them in case of theft and in some cases, I feel we’re right to do so but not always. What use is a brilliant idea if it’s not being used? Holding on tightly to an idea you’re almost certain of leaving in the corner of your mind is just a waste of brain power. Why not pass it onto someone you know and trust? If you really can’t bear to give it away, you have to use it.\n\nSo that’s what I plan to do. I will outsource the ideas I know I will never finish and be happier for the relief of the burden and know I’ve contributed to the flow of creativity in some way.

I'm a huge fan of his work and the album that featured the most amongst those minutes was his Final Fantasy 7 album, _VII_. It's a comfort album and a sampling masterpiece.

My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won't do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there's no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that's a vast improvement on 2016, the **Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.**\n\n## Accepting My Mental Health Problems and Getting Help\n\nBeing a mathematician at heart, I like to think of things in analytical terms. Using a scale of 0-10, I'd give this year an average of 3 and a variance of 5. There have been peaks but plenty of troughs and it's been hell trying to navigate through them. Anyone who follows me on Twitter will have seen my tweets on mental health and some on my own personal life. Despite this, I find it difficult to write about my life in this form. But here we are. People have often remarked at my cool exterior even in moments where others would feel stress. I never used to notice it but now I make sure to maintain this for my own peace of mind. Unfortunately, all that goes out of the window when I enter a stressful situation where I'm tasked with resolving that turmoil. Over the last few years, I have developed anxiety laced with bouts of depression. I've had difficulty controlling my anger during arguments and stressful situations, resorting to the foulest of comments for which I'm ashamed. But anger isn't to blame. I am the sole culprit. Hitting rock bottom leaves you with two choices: stay there for good or find your way back up. I chose the latter. I self referred back to a counselling service and received [CBT](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/) for the first time. I'd received mixed reviews on its effectiveness but I knew it was the appropriate action for my problems. I didn't need medications and anything less than CBT (which I got last December) would have been useless. I had a lovely counsellor who listened and gave me the tools I needed and some food for thought: I needed to be more assertive. It's all a work in progress so I'll let you know at the end of 2018 how I've been doing with that.\n\n## Learning To Be Comfortable Alone After A Breakup\n\nI started the year with a breakup. It was meant to be The Relationship but it hadn't been right for a long time. I played my part and I'm still haunted by some of my actions. I've reached a comfortable plateau with that after a few torrid months in the middle of the year. But amongst all the mess, I learnt how to be okay on my own. I got my own place (more on that later) and found solace in my own space. I still feel lonely at times but then I remember what certain kinds of company I desired would mean and I came to appreciate the environment I was in. I had time to work on my own projects, make my own meals or order in, go out if/when I wanted to - living my life. It was the first time in my life I'd lived on my own and I wouldn't trade it for anything right now. I don't know what the future holds for my love life. I've often segued into relationships or had long stretches being single but yearning for someone but I've not had that this time. Who knows what 2018 will bring. Again, I'll keep you posted.\n\n## Getting My Own Place\n\nI spent the first seven months of the year living with my sister. The change in environment was helpful and I'm so grateful to my sister for that comfort. But I still needed to find my own place. After 6 viewings, I found something 10 minutes from my sister's house and I've loved the place ever since. It's a first floor flat in one of the poshest areas in the city but it's been a dream to live here since I moved. The decor is simple and to my favourite colour scheme: white and grey. It can feel lonely sometimes but it's my home and welcome relief from work. I've laughed to myself more there than I have in years. It's mine.\n\n## I'm Certified, Baby!\n\nMy job hunt has been a nightmare. I've applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I'd passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we'll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I'll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I'll win the race in 2018.\n\n## I Got A Break\n\nLisbon. What a city. [I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine](/posts/my-week-in-lisbon/) and the week away was the best time I've ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally \"be\". Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I've ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That's my new \"soul hub\".\n\n## Could \"Pandog Media\" Be The Answer?\n\nI've been [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) for years and started [Sampleface](/projects/sampleface/) as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started [Cultrface](/projects/cultrface/). This year, I started [LOGiCFACE](/projects/logicface/) (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and [Playrface](/projects/playrface/). But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that's where Pandog Media came from. It's only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It's often suggested to blog in your free time if you can't get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I've also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I'm tired of that and I want that to change. I don't know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I'll take them on instead.\n\n(You can also find out more about Pandog Media on its [Projects page](/projects/pandog-media/).)\n\nSo that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.","src/content/posts/my-review-of-2017.md","682fb753df0af303",{"html":4408,"metadata":4409},"\u003Cp>This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn’t going to publish anything.

It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\n\nThe inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I've made in years. When I decided this, I hadn't considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March's edition of [Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/). They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation's virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I'd visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I'd travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents' house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn't go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn't bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn't realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was €345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the [Estadio Jose Alvalade](https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade). The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night's sleep in months, if not years.\n\n## Tuesday - Terça-feira\n\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn't included but at €7 a day, it was great value. I didn't fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I'd mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I'm back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at [Italian Burger & Lobster House](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn't until 7:45pm. I'd picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only €0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/). There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of _[pasteis de nata](https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html)_ for the first time - Lisbon's delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn't too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only €6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I'd only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn't any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium's station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I've ever had.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for €3) and stayed in my room all day. I'd been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn't anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn't regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a _[börek](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/borek-recipe)_ for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn't a total waste and I got some new clothes.\n\n## Friday - Sexta-feira\n\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit [MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)](https://www.maat.pt/en). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It's reminscient of Birmingham's Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Belém coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called [Las Ficheras](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d5603647-Reviews-LAS_FICHERAS-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html). Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\n\n## Saturday - Sábado\n\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn't stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Belém for the [Museu Coleção Berardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berardo_Collection_Museum), a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Belém which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn't surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dalí and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at [Este Oeste](https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/), a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life. \n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado (or **MNAC** for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) since entry was only €4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren't to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A €13 buffet wasn't to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I've since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I'd ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the São Sebastião station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Inglés, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for €4. That's when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents' nearest station. Metro rides were €1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over £5.\n\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That's why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I'd been in 5 years. It's definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I'd love to live in the future. I wasn't able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.","src/content/posts/my-week-in-lisbon.md","8b01193e78e5f735",{"html":4445,"metadata":4446},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/MAAT-Lisbon-Amanda-Levet-Architects-0016_1.png\" alt=\"MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon. It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I’ve made in years. When I decided this, I hadn’t considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March’s edition of \u003Ca href=\"https://monocle.com/magazine/\">Monocle\u003C/a>. They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation’s virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I’d visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"monday---segunda-feira\">Monday - Segunda-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>My flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I’d travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents’ house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn’t go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn’t bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn’t realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was €345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade\">Estadio Jose Alvalade\u003C/a>. The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night’s sleep in months, if not years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tuesday---terça-feira\">Tuesday - Terça-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn’t included but at €7 a day, it was great value. I didn’t fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I’d mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I’m back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at \u003Ca href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10295169-Reviews-Italian_Burguer_Lobster_House-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html\">Italian Burger &#x26; Lobster House\u003C/a>. I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"wednesday---quarta-feira\">Wednesday - Quarta-feira\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>My first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn’t until 7:45pm. I’d picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only €0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the \u003Ca href=\"https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/\">Museu Calouste Gulbenkian\u003C/a>. There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of \u003Cem>\u003Ca href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html\">pasteis de nata\u003C/a>\u003C/em> for the first time - Lisbon’s delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn’t too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only €6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I’d only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn’t any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium’s station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect.

It's not that I'm ashamed of my [neurodivergence](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent) (ND) but rather the fact that I'm self-diagnosing and people LOVE to say *something*.\n\nBut how did I get here? Well, seeing as a professional diagnosis would either involve a 2-year+ wait on the NHS or a 1–2 year wait if I went private and cost me about £2,000, I decided to do some online tests. Before you say anything, I know these aren't any kind of \"proof\" but they're good indicators and I did three of them to get a better overview.\n\nThe scores all came out high.\n\n* 42 in the [AQ test](https://embrace-autism.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/) (threshold is 26)\n* 129 in the [RAADS–R test](https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/) (threshold is 65)\n* 138 in the [CAT-Q test](https://embrace-autism.com/cat-q/) (threshold is 100)\n* 44 in the [RBQ-2A test](https://embrace-autism.com/rbq-2a/) (threshold is 26; 36 is the average autistic score)\n\n4 tests above the threshold has to count for something, right? I'll speak to a doctor eventually but my circumstances will be changing soon so I'll need to register with a new surgery to the one I'm at now. When things are settled, I'll do that. In the meantime, I'm self-diagnosing.\n\nIn terms of why I'm saying \"probably\" autistic... it's because I'd feel more comfortable with an official diagnosis. I know I definitely fall into the neurodivergent category; nothing typical about me on that front! I'm still navigating all of these thoughts and feelings, piecing together years of wondering what was \"wrong\" with me or why people said certain things about me and whether they were true. But the autistic traits I've been reading about have definitely answered some life long questions.\n\nBesides declaring all this, I also wanted to write out something pointers for people who read this and ever interact with me. Because I'm ND, I don't engage with people or things in the same way and as I would respect other people's way of being, I want the same for me. So here's a list of things ([because I love lists, duh!](/lists/)) about me which I'll update as an when I remember them.\n\n## 1. I get overwhelmed easily\n\nThis is gotten really bad lately. Multi-tasking is not my thing, which means working in an agency across multiple accounts is difficult at times. I try my best to plan things out but I also just want to get things done. Here, I'd say if you ever need something from me, it's best to ask if I'm available, be super clear on what you want, and when you want it and do it all within the first request. Vague openers usually give me anxiety and I might feel pressure to commit.\n\n## 2. I don't like small talk or \"networking\"\n\nI'll do small talk with my mum because it's safe and easy. I can't do it with strangers because I have no idea what people really think or feel when talking to me, and I've had comments based on my appearance from the get-go (gotta love casual racism). That's not to say I want deep, meaningful conversations immediately&mdash;or ever&mdash;but the truth is I get nervous when I have to talk to people. I feel like I waffle and that I'm putting on an act, as if I'm pretending to be a \"normal\" human being. I used to be better in like 2019 but it's gotten worse since the pandemic (understandable trust issues!!!) and my social anxiety is at an all-time high. I have nothing to recommend here. It's a social \"thing\" to have icebreakers and group work and small talk and I don't see that ever stopping, even if there are probably tests showing they don't work as well. But if you have an opportunity to not do those things and accommodate for ND people, do it. Because that's the inclusive part of \"diversity and inclusion\".\n\n## 3. My short term memory sucks\n\nYou know when you go into a room and forget why you're there? Well, imagine that but it's pretty much every time you go into a room. I have to sometimes say what I'm there for over and over in my head like a Buddhist chant. I get distracted more than ever before and, while I think I can return my focus to the thing I was meant to do, it doesn't always happen. I hate it. And I've already forgotten what the next part should be while writing this!\n\n## 4. I prefer to work alone\n\nAll the things you've ever see me create? 99.9% of it was done alone. I don't like to rely on people too much as I appreciate we all have lives to live and can't definitely commit. That means if I know I need something and I can do it myself, I will. And so I work alone and find a way where I can. Working with one other person works for me but whole groups with multiple voices? I'm not good at it and I don't feel like I should assimilate because \"that's just how it's done\". Reject tradition; embrace chaos!\n\n## 5. I need detailed explanations\n\nI've had to learn how to read between the lines when people ask me to do things or tell me stuff. But it's very tiring and I don't always get what people are trying to say. So I need detailed explanations if you want me to do something for you. Vagueness confuses me or will lead me to try a method that takes more time than I should spend on the task. That doesn't necessarily mean hand-holding but I tend to get flustered if I go down a path and get told that I'm doing it wrong or \"why are you doing it that way?!\"\n\n## 6. I hyperfocus a lot\n\nI love learning, especially if I find something cool. But that can lead to hyperfocusing, which means I'll hone in on something and spend hours getting into it. Building this website is an example of that. I spent hours over weeks in 2021 putting this site together and learning Astro. Same goes for Neo4j and graph science. And Python. Even Pokémon back when I was young (although that's probably not indicative to autism as it's Pokémon after all lol). Hyperfocusing has lead me to build knowledge in a lot of areas but the downside is creating time sinks where I could be doing literally anything else. Like resting. Less sleep is not good, no matter what people tell you.\n\n## 7. Too much noise gives me sensory overload\n\nI like my peace and quiet a lot of the time. So when I'm in a shopping centre or at work or even at home where my son watches TV at a loud volume and then plays on his Switch at near full volume, it gets too much. It's why I often have headphones in as a way to regulate the sounds I hear. Sensory overload often turns into irritability so if you catch me in that funk, give me a second.\n\n**Sidenote**: _if you have any comments about this, for yourself, and we know each other, feel free to talk to me. If you have any criticisms, keep them to yourself. If you have any advice, ask me whether I'm open to this first. I don't like unsolicited advice as it often comes from a different life experience to mine and the rapport is almost never established beforehand so it sounds like someone offering a smile, a biscuit, and a cup of tea for mental health issues. I've been accused of being standoffish and aloof many times before when I've actually been struggling and nobody thought to check in first. Don't be that person._\n\n## Resources\n\n* [How I get shit done (or at least get started) while having executive dysfunction](https://www.autisticasfxxk.com/blog/get-shit-done/) - This is sound advice for any other neurodivergent folks reading this\n* [As an Autistic Psychologist, Here Are My Thoughts on Autism and Self-Diagnosis](https://www.verywellmind.com/self-diagnosis-according-to-an-autistic-psychologist-8650879) - This is so helpful!","src/content/posts/probably-autistic.md","c230b3ca8bab1c6a",{"html":4631,"metadata":4632},"\u003Cp>My name is Luke and I’m Probably Autistic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been wanting to write this for months but been afraid of what (neurotypical) people might say.

I've always had something to say about my favourite things and when I discovered blogging in 2008, I jumped on the bandwagon. As a teenager, I had a lot to say and rant about because I felt everything so passionately. I still have that passion but only for specific things and much less than I used to. Now, most of my writing comes in the form of shitposts on social media and the more serious stuff goes here.\n\n## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?\n\nI use [WordPress](/jardim/tech/wordpress/) for most of my blogs and [Astro](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/how-astro-changed-my-web-life/) for this one. WordPress is easier for larger sites and Astro is the latest static site generator I've used for my personal site. Previously, I've used [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), WordPress, and I handcoded the site in the early days. I chose Astro because it was easy to use, intuitive, and meant I could use as much or as little JavaScript as I needed without learning any other languages.\n\n## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?\n\nOn this site, I just use Sublime Text and write it out manually. I've been trying [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) lately but I'm still getting to grips with it. Baby steps.\n\n## When do you feel most inspired to write?\n\nWhen I think I have something to say or feel really strongly about something. I have a content workflow where I save interesting links and post about them on my other blogs while here, things are more personal and often longform so they're not as frequent.\n\n## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?\n\nI mostly write and publish but if it needs time, I let it simmer.\n\n## What’s your favourite post on your blog?\n\n[Last Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend](/posts/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/), [Being Black in digital marketing in 2023](/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/), [Some caveats to SEO and web performance](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf/), and [Probably Autistic](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/probably-autistic/)\n\n## Any future plans for your blog?

My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I'd never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn't until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was \"WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn't human!\" but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn't keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life.

I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I'd never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn't believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I'd never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I'd revered and loved so much - gone.

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 12 things I've picked up over that period.",[806,236],["Date","2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/posts/first-year-professional-seo/)).\n\nHere is what I've learnt in my second year as a professional.\n\n## People\n\n### 1. Women in SEO are still the best\n\nThis hasn't changed from last year.\n\nThe women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn't have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.\n\nGet more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.\n\n### 2. Experts still aren't experts\n\nAnother reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.\n\nI hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.\n\n### 3. You can't rely on others to make changes in diversity\n\nThe death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.\n\nIt left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can't rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won't face their internal situations.\n\nAnd that's partly why I started my Marketers of Colour project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That's my sole focus right now.\n\n### 4. John Mueller is even more awesome\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\n\n## Keywords\n\n### 5. It's still about topics\n\nI've been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I've seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don't copy your competition, you \"listen\" to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise\n\nWhen I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I'm more of a \"jack of all trades\" in SEO (and that's not a criticism in this game!)\n\nI hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It's where I want to be.\n\n### 7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.\n\n2020 being 2020, I didn't do much with Python besides using the scripts I'd already written. But I need to get back into it\n\n### 8. I love Ahrefs\n\nI wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it's so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.\n\n### 9. I need to finally use a new API for a project\n\nI still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven't done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the PokéAPI. Something with natures. I don't know. Help!\n\n## Content and Links\n\n### 10. I want to get better at link building\n\nI remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the \"dark side\" aka digital PR and while I'll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.\n\n## Misc\n\n### 11. You shouldn't \"live and breathe marketing\"\n\nWhen you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to \"live and breathe\" what you do isn't it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn't so important that it has to consume your existence.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn't and shouldn't be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I'm glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There'll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn't be the only thing we face.\n\n### 12. I love writing for the Small Web\n\nA few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They're at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.\n\nOh, I haven't explained what they are. Briefly:\n\n- Commercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for _conversions_, _landing pages_, _sales funnels_, and _ROI_.\n- Small Web = the old days of [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) where you wrote about stuff that wasn't for SEO, posted links with no other content\n\nUnless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won't rank as highly. It's that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing _too_ much on SEO. In some cases, I don't care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I _still_ got traffic.\n\nWhen people ask me what advice I'd give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say \"get a blog\". Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to:\n\n- Ruth Everett\n- Ronke Lawal\n- Rejoice Ojiaku\n- Sophie Logan\n- Surena Chande\n- Saffron Shergill\n- Azeem Ahmad\n- Tom Mortimer\n- Areej AbuAli\n- Tatiana Mac\n- Jamar Ramos\n- Olivia-Mae Foong\n- Lucy Robinson\n- Natalie Arney\n- Petar Jovetic\n- Dan Taylor\n\nAnd loads of other people I've not mentioned who have made my second year as an SEO a great one.","src/content/posts/second-year-professional-seo.md","47cddf69c7065bf7",{"html":4793,"metadata":4794},"\u003Cp>Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (\u003Ca href=\"/posts/first-year-professional-seo/\">read about my first year here\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here is what I’ve learnt in my second year as a professional.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"people\">People\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-women-in-seo-are-still-the-best\">1.

Those nickname submissions also date as far back as 2007. Sites like this would have had a lot of traffic back then and while it might have decreased, they'll maintain a steady stream today. I did a rough [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) search of over 400 \"Pokémon + nicknames\" queries (e.g. `fuecoco nicknames`) and found average monthly search volumes of up to 900 and total of 29,000.

That's because I decided to make some design changes. I haven't documented those changes anywhere so I'll explain what they are to the best of my knowledge and why I did it.\n\n## Ch-ch-ch-changes\n\n### 1. The header nav is smaller and more spread out\n\nI was heavily inspired by https://anhvn.com/ ([who I posted in my last blog](/posts/i-also-love-my-website/)) and how she had a thinner header strip. It just looks neater. With making it smaller, I've had to take out some of the links I didn't feel were worthy of a prominent place on every page on the site. That may change but for now, this is who it'll look.\n\n### 2. I've replaced Arial Black with Erode as the headings font\n\nIf you remember, I used to have two custom fonts for my main body and heading fonts but I thought it was silly to have the biggest files on my site in terms of size as fonts when the site was mostly text. It wasn't dragging UX performance down significantly but I wanted a site that could be loaded as fast as possible on all connections.\n\nThen I got bored of Arial Black.\n\nSo I took inspiration from Anh again and, rather than use Tiempos Text as well (1. I can't justify buying it and 2. I don't want to _copy_.), I went to look for a free serif font with some sophistication. And that's when I found Erode. Luckily, its file size is small (about 23KB or something) and my Lighthouse scores are still all 100s (I know, I know, they don't mean anything but without the traffic, I can't use field data and I like round figures, okay?!)\n\nI think it looks great and I'm happy with my choice.\n\n### 3. Wiki is now \"Jardim\" and Wikinotes are now \"Recortes\"\n\nOkay, so I'm not Portuguese but I've been learning the language since 2017 and visited Lisbon 3 times (and I'm going again next month). Besides Duolingo, I have no means of practice when I'm not there so I felt a good way to break out of the app would be to add some of that \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">sabor português\u003C/span> into my website.\n\nI realised that \"wiki\" wasn't working as a name for that area of my site and I was getting impressions for [KEYWORD + wiki] search terms which I didn't want. I also didn't want to call it a \"garden\" as, again, didn't want to copy so I went with \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">jardim\u003C/span>. That meant wikinotes had to go and, in keeping with the theme, I went with \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">recortes\u003C/span>, which means \"cuttings\" in English. Like leaf cuttings or newspaper cuttings? \u003Cspan lang=\"fr\">Double entendre!\u003C/span> This post is suddenly getting very multilingual.\n\n### 4. I've started using Content Collections\n\nOne of the biggest issues with my site before was how content and dynamic pagination worked. I had to have folders in separate places with slightly different names that didn't work.\n\nAn example was all the blog posts had a URL slug of `/post/` rather than `/posts/`, the latter of which was only used for the index. Then, things like Release Notes and Morsels were housed under `/post/` and they were their own thing.\n\nI use Astro as my site framework and their Content Collections API has been around for a while. But I was wary of having to refactor my entire site and risk the loss of organic traffic (of what little traffic I get) but you know what? Screw it. I got sick of struggling and having messy code and folders so I did it over the course of two days. It wasn't easy but I figured stuff out and got it working. Then I fixed the broken links and set up redirects in the .htaccess file. And now things are better. So blog posts and the index are all under `/posts/`.\n\n### 5. Tags are gone\n\nThey were a workaround and weren't great so nothing lost really, other than some internal linking. But there are better ways to do that, once I figure them out. There is a proper way to do it but one step at a time.\n\nAnd thanks again to Anh for the inspiration to make those changes.","src/content/posts/site-redesign.md","5dcf57c9d7d70454",{"html":4911,"metadata":4912},"\u003Cp>Hello.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You may have noticed the site looks a little different.

And it's shorter. Short and unsweetened.\n\n## 1. I'm more bored of AI than last year\n\nA big one straight out of the gate. I started getting into AI a few years ago. I found it fascinating how you could take a dataset and train a model with it to create something personalised for all kinds of tasks. Generative AI seemed cool and new and shiny at the start but as time has gone on and with the widespread issues that this tech has, I've not only lost interest in a general sense but I've also grown bored of it.\n\nCompanies keep giving big tech corps money and brute forcing the technology into their services where it doesn't belong. Chatbots are fallible, prone to confabulations, could be harmful in so many ways, their underlying tech is bad for the environment. The list goes on. I', happy to give professional opinions on AI when asked as that's my job but my personal interest has diminished significantly. My only interest lies in NLP and specific machine learning techniques like embeddings and how they can be used for certain tasks. I still love using [RALTS](/posts/introducing-ralts/) and I actually use a local LLM from time to time when I want to do lower-level things like emails when I'm anxious and can't think of the words to say or nickname ideas for Pokémon and I don't use any of the outputs verbatim (see: [AI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started](/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/))\n\n## 2. I'm still learning and relearning technical SEO and its importance\n\nIt's been 3.5 years since I officially became a technical SEO and despite being a senior now, I'm still learning and relearning about the discipline. One of the biggest lessons I've learnt over time is that not everything in tech is \"important\" based on certain criteria. Does a small site need to prioritise tech health? Not really, but it might if the foundations are shaky or there are early plans to expand. Big sites definitely need to keep on top of it but they often come with 6–12 month turnaround times for (relatively) small changes and you have to figure out a way to demonstrate importance with or without a business case.\n\nAudits aren't just checklists of any and every issue found in an auditing tool. This isn't new information and, in fact, a lot of tech SEOs will tell you this (if they haven't already written a blog post about it on their websites). Sometimes, a site just doesn't need a tech view and that should be okay to say. It's all about showing what will make a difference and how, if any. Then you have to try and measure it as best you can which comes with its own issues. A lot of common fixes won't affect ranking but may affect visibility but content and links affect both. How can you show your technical work did something when there are other contributing factors with unknown weights behind them all? Are there conclusive tests for this with strong methodologies? These are the questions I've tried to explore this year when I've had the time. \n\n## 3. I still love web performance and I still think it's more a CRO/UX thing than an SEO thing\n\nWhile I'm still doing plenty of Core Web Vitals audits and pushing back where site speed isn't a priority, I have started advocating for more involvement with CRO because web performance affects user experience and sessions more than visibility and ranking. I've yet to see enough convincing arguments to the contrary so the shift makes sense to me. Plus, it's easier to measure using UX metrics. Web performance doesn't do the heavy lifting when it comes to the SERP to site journey but it does in the site to conversion journey and that should be the focus.\n\n## 4. But reading about SEO or web performance outside of work hours gives me anxiety\n\nThis is a weird one but it's real. For some reason, whenever I see stuff about SEO outside of work, I get really anxious. I think it reminds me of how I feel like I'm \"behind\" everyone else because I'm not front and centre with my opinions or reading everything about everything. It's a very opinionated and expert-y space and I hate that a lot. If all that hot air was used to demystify the industry and make everything more accessible, that'd be fine. But it's still so snarky and corporate and I have no time for it. So I try to focus on what I think matters and filter everything else out.\n\n## 5. I don't feel like I'm doing meaningful work\n\nAnd the biggest one for last. [I wrote about this a few weeks ago](/posts/am-i-helping-or-harming/) but I don't feel like I'm making as positive a difference to the world as I'd like. I can't ignore what's happening out there right now and while SEO isn't there to change that (at least on its own), I don't always see the real changes I make for whoever I make them for. I'm not an expert or some kind of figurehead for anything so I won't know if I've inspired anyone from a professional perspective. So the disillusionment grows. Still got some thinking to do there.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to anyone who has helped me on my journey this year.

The speed and overall performance of a page can affect how well a search engine crawler can crawl and index a page (amongst many other factors). The usual way to define that is through metrics like Google's [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals/), which form part of their [Page Experience ranking signal](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience)\u003Csup>\u003Ca href =\"#sidenote\">\\*\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>. But there's a problem I've noticed between both SEO and web performance communities: people are giving too much weight to Core Web Vitals from a ranking perspective.\n\nNow, I'm going to use an example from [Speedcurve](https://www.speedcurve.com/) to illustrate this. I don't think the information on their [SEO and Web Performance](https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance) is terrible or incorrect but I feel like some caveats are important to avoid misunderstandings or heated debates between businesses and their in-house SEOs/agencies.\n\nIn the section titled [How much does web performance matter when it comes to SEO?](https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance#how-much-does-web-performance-matter-when-it-comes-to-seo), they say the following:\n\n>Since Web Vitals were announced, they've shot to the top of many people's list of things to care about. But Google's prioritization of page speed in search ranking isn't new, even for mobile. As far back as 2013, Google announced that pages that load slowly on mobile devices would be penalized in mobile search.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>Performance has had an impact on SEO long before Web Vitals came along. Back in 2011, Smartfurniture.com [shared](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/the-growing-need-for-speed-how-site-performance-increasingly-influences-search-rankings):\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>\"We discovered we could make a quantum leap in search engine rankings simply by increasing site performance. Across the board, we’ve seen sales increases because of our improved ranking, with 20% more organic traffic being driven to our site and 14% more page views.\"\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>More recently, Pinterest [shared](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7#.wwimdmkpp) that rebuilding their site with performance in mind resulted in a 15% increase in organic search traffic. (You can find more SEO-related case studies at [WPOstats.com](https://wpostats.com/tags/seo/).)\n\n## What the Speed Update really meant\n\nThe first flag for me was regarding Google's penalisation of slow sites in mobile search. There was an [announcement in 2018 in a Google blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search) but \"penalised\" is a problematic word to use in this context (and **many** news sites ran with it at the time). The reason for that is because Google has a [manual penalty system](https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509) for serious cases such as black hat tactics such as keyword cloaking, keyword stuffing, [private blog networks (or PBNs)](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/private-blog-network), and misleading redirects.\n\nIf you get caught, Google \"penalises\" you by dropping your rank or deindexing completely. Most people are aware of these kinds of penalties so using that terminology to describe the effects of having a slow site can give the wrong connotations. So to be clear and diligent, a slow site will not tank your rankings directly. Sites that have issues that don't allow them to be crawled and indexed correctly will see rankings fall and slow speeds could be associative in those cases but not the primary or sole cause. _Hope that makes sense; let me know if not! x_\n\nAn important paragraph from the 2018 blog post is this:\n\n> The \"Speed Update\", as we're calling it, will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.\n\nSo this isn't necessarily sitewide, it only affects a small portion of queries, and a slow page might not see a change in rank because of its content relevance. And that's how seach should work. The biggest sites in terms of indexed pages and popularity are in the vast minority on the Web. A lot of them are also memory, storage, data, and time hogs. You don't see them falling down the rankings or out of them completely so perhaps speed isn't _that_ big a deal compared to other signals like content relevance, link profiles, and efficient crawling and indexation.\n\n## Web performance doesn't always correlate with organic ranking\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"float-img-right\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/i-make-lots-of-graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Simpson holding up a graph with the caption 'I make a lot of graphs'\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" />\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Lisa is clearly an SEO.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nA few studies were quoted in the referenced Speedcurve paragraph, from Smartfurniture.com and Pinterest. Now, case studies are important to show how changes can have significant impacts&mdash;good or bad. But it is so difficult to attribute web performance changes in SEO without taking other factors into account. You often see percentages and monetary figures but rarely what happened to get to those stages. And then there are the confusions between users engaging with SERPs (search engine results pages) and users engaging with the site once they click the SERP listing link.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, a slow page may still rank highly so you can't attribute performance improvements to improved impressions or clicks. Factors like [seasonality](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seasonal-seo-tips/438300/), competitors, updates, content relevance, and link profiles make a bigger difference on that front. Once you're on the page, then speed can become a factor. But what happens if you make content changes at the same time? Or change the links on the page? Which one made the most difference? It's hard to say for sure.\n\nThat's not to say I doubt that improving web performance makes a difference to conversions and general organic performance but it requires a methodology and careful analysis to attribute the changes to the right places.\n\n## Who Core Web Vitals is really for\n\nThe section titled [Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?](https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/seo-and-web-performance#which-performance-metrics-should-you-focus-on-for-seo) examines metrics to look out for when measuring performance and where you can improve. There are four listed:\n\n* [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp)\n* [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/articles/fid)\n* [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp/)\n* [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls)\n\nLCP, FID, and CLS are currently the Core Web Vitals metrics, while [INP will replace FID in March 2024](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv). As Google created these as best measures for web performance (in their eyes, and they know they aren't perfect), I agree these should be metrics to focus on. But my issue is with the title:\n\n**Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?**\n\nThe question should be:\n\n**Which performance metrics should you focus on for \u003Cspan style=\"color:#FC1420;\">_users_\u003C/span>?**\n\nOf course, I get that this whole page is about SEO and web performance but users are the common denominator at every stage of the journey. A site can rank #1 for a term and very few people click on the link in the SERPs ([thanks, Google Ads!](https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-are-dark-patterns/)).\n\nIf they do though, they navigate the site, may convert, may not, may abandon their cart, may not, may leave, may come back, may not. All of that may be because of site speed or visual shifts. Or it could be people being indecisive or wanting to save money. UX plays a crucial part in all of that, which is why Core Web Vitals and web performance shouldn't be so tightly bound with SEO; it should be connected with UX in a cute [Ring a Ring o' Roses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeMcG5OT5BU)-type relationship. Oh, and devs too. They can join in... I guess!\n\n## The bottom line\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/stone-cold.jpg\" alt=\"A white male wrestler named Stone Cold, wearing some black briefs and boots talking into a mic with anger.

I feel like a broken record for saying this (at least in my head) but improving CWV metrics won't boost organic rankings without a lot of caveats but it most certainly will improve organic session quality, leading to better session duration, conversions, and revenue.\n\nUsers don't know how slow your site is in the SERPs but they'll find out once they click the link so prepare for that part and let helpful content, link building, and EEAT do the preliminary work.\n\nThis is the kind of message we need to send to clients and our peers when discussing why CWV is important. We need to be specific or we're gonna look like snake oil merchants (oh wait, we already do: look at SEO's reputation with devs and the media \\*side-eyes The Verge\\*)\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to pick on Speedcurve or suggesting they suck or they're telling lies (I actually like their product and the people I know of that work there as they do really awesome work in the web performance sector so thank you!) My overrarching point is this: when we talk about SEO and web performance, we need to refrain from saying things like \"improving site speed is a ranking factor and doing so will improve your SEO ranking\". Those kinds of statements are either not true or barely true or only giving a small portion of the information needed to be true.\n\nThe real truth is that Page Experience is just one signal amongst many others and within Page Experience, Core Web Vitals is one part of many. That means it's not heavily weighted and people (who know that) should be saying it. At the moment, I fear that people thinking there's an equal weight to content, links, and page speed when that just isn't the case. Where page speed _is_ heavily weighted is in direct user experiences and people's abilities to navigate websites in a way that makes them stay, return, and feel comfortable to do both. If it's a commercial site, they're more likely to buy stuff or sign up to stuff. If it's informational, they're more likely to read and comment.\n\nPeople will always click links on SERPs. They might not always stay on your site for long. Web performance is therefore more important for the latter than the former and SEO, UX, dev work, and higher-ups buy-in should work together to make that all happen and make everyone happy. Or happier at least.\n\n\u003Cp id=\"sidenote\">\u003Csmall>\u003Cem>*Please note: Page Experience is *not* a ranking system and Google has said that before and I don't want to piss Danny Sullivan off any more than he likely seems to be when people misattribute his/Google's official documentation, even if it isn't always _that_ clear but I digress.\u003C/em>\u003C/small>\u003C/p>","src/content/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf.md","e382e85747cb2a23",{"html":4983,"metadata":4984},"\u003Cp>As a technical SEO, I am very passionate about web performance.

I was finally in the career I'd fought to get into for the past 8 years, money was alright, I had a partner and I was happy. And then [2020 did its thing](/jardim/covid-19/) and ran through my life like a wrecking ball. But of all the things that the last couple of years have ruined that upsets me the most, it's the work on my social anxiety.\n\nWhen I was a child, I was very outgoing and had little inhibitions. Confidence was sky high (to the point of arrogance sometimes but being precocious is part of childhood, right?) Then high school changed that. I had friendship group but I always felt... different or \"outside\". I was picked on quite a lot in my final year and made a very stupid decision a few years before that for me excluded for a week (I won't discuss that here). College was my attempt to shrug off my academic prowess for a taste of pseudo-extroversion and it kinda worked for a couple of years, and into uni but then I developed depression. And dropped out.\n\nAnyway, skip 14 years and in that time, I realised a few things:\n\n* That \"outsider\" feeling was probably the fact that I was neurodivergent without knowing what the hell that was (recently, I took a few online tests that suggested I had \"severe\" symptoms for autism and while I won't go into that in this post, that makes more sense to me than anything in the last few years - although I'm not sure about the word \"severe\" but I digress)\n* I was an introvert and still am (I didn't discover that until 2012)\n* I wasn't comfortable with who I was and desperately tried to be someone else until the pretence became so exhausting I couldn't keep it up\n\nAnd only now do I have the self confidence I needed all those years ago. But it feels like it's come at a cost. I feel more isolated than ever. I don't feel like I fit in with anyone bar a small group of mostly online friends. Everything about socialising makes me feel uncomfortable, anxious, and skeptical. What do people want from me when I talk to them? Do I need to say lots? Have they judged me already and want me to leave? Do they think I'm weird? Do I make too many weird references? Am I annoying? Do people hate me?

You can automate a lot of things but because no two sites are ever truly the same, you, the SEO, need to pick out what really matters and what doesn't. For me, it's better if a human does it compared to a catch-all solution or a machine learning tool.\n\nOne thing that I've grown accustomed to is assessing the use and unintentional misuse of robots.txt. If you don't know, robots.txt is a text file that contains instructions that a search engine bot should follow when crawling a site. The most common directives relate to what pages a crawler can and can't crawl, using the keywords `allow` and `disallow`.\n\nHere's what mine looks like:\n\n```\nUser-agent: *\nAllow: /\n\nUser-Agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-Agent: GPTBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Google-Extended\nDisallow: /\n\nSitemap: https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/sitemap.xml\n```\n\nThis says that any crawler can crawl the site... except ChatGPT-User, GPTBot, and Google-Extended (which are all AI crawlers, although given their current practices for scraping, these might be redundant).\n\nOn e-commerce sites, you'll see a lot of URL path types blocked from crawls such as search pages (e.g. **example.org/search/blah+blah+blah**) and filter parameter pages (e.g. **example.org/?filter=colour&size=large**). But, for Google, this isn't always the best way. [In their documentation on robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro), they say:\n\n>  A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.\n\nThat's arguably the most important point of the documentation. Robots.txt is there to stop your servers from getting overloaded by crawl requests through carefully selected directives. That's where the efficiency lies. But blocking pages from being crawled won't block it from getting into the index, and a lot of sites (often by default) have directives that disallow common page types as described above.\n\nNow, Googlebot often follows this correctly and they will get blocked and therefore won't get indexed but it's not guaranteed to stay that way, especially if you happen to link to those blocked pages anywhere else, and in abundance. I've come across sites that link to blocked filter pages _at scale_ and since links are heavily weighted Google's search algorithms, they see this as a strong signal for indexation. The result: blocked pages get indexed. This isn't inherently a bad thing for search as these pages aren't optimised and won't take up much if any visiblity for a site for important keywords... but they could, and if you've used a technique for one thing, you don't want it to be ignored or mess up your overall strategy.\n\nSo what do you do in these situations? Drum roll please...\n\n🥁 🥁 🥁\n\n...IT DEPENDS! 🎉 🍾\n\nBut seriously, as Google said, if you don't want a page to be indexed, use noindex. Robots.txt wasn't designed for noindexation so don't use it for that. The reason why so many frameworks and platforms block certain page types like search and filters is often sites have thousands of pages and you'll want a crawler to focus on product and category pages over things like in-site search. In fact, these pages are often canonicalised or noindexed anyway in which case blocking them via robots.txt could actually be a problem anyway (it might not see the noindex or canonical if it's blocked).\n\nSo, to sum up: \n\n* If you want to stop Googlebot from pressuring your servers with crawl requests (based on evidence that Googlebot is doing this in the first place), add a disallow directive.\n* If you have a smaller site* and just don't want pages to be indexed, add a noindex tag and don't sweat the technique. I mean, crawling of those pages.\n\nCrawl effiency isn't a concern for a small site as Googlebot can handle this without issue.

Instead, I've learnt when copying and pasting data into an IDE and deleting what I don't need has been the quickest solution.\n\n## The task at hand\n\nLet me give you an example. I wanted to gather a list of artists to check for potential music samples as I'm working on a new project. I picked an producer on WhoSampled who I knew had impeccable taste in samples and my task was to get all the original artist names that they'd sampled from. Because there were 9 pages of samples, it wouldn't be as simple as writing down a few names so my options were:\n\n1. Scrape the pages using Screaming Frog and extract the text I needed\n2. Use Python to extract the text I needed\n3. Maybe even use JavaScript to do it in the console\n4. Open each page in 9 tabs and Select All, Cmd+C, Cmd+V, and use Regex to delete everything that didn't have the artist name in it\n\n## Which solution is best?\n\nNow the first three could have been quick solutions in theory:\n\n* In Screaming Frog, you can add a list of URLs and use [Custom Extraction](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/tutorials/web-scraping/) to pull the CSS selectors or XPaths containing the text you need.\n* Python would have been quick too with Requests and Beautiful Soup (which I've combined into my own hosted package for these kinds of tasks). But both of those solutions required me looking for the precise CSS selectors and/or writing the code to get the text and maybe troubleshoot (because I almost never do it right the first time).\n* JavaScript could have worked but I'm still not 100% confident with it and I'd be tinkering with it for longer than I'd want.\n\nThat left the fourth one. It was rough but it was ready. The shortcut commands are second nature to me so there wasn't a risk of being slow or needing to troubleshoot. What's more, there were no need for identifying CSS selectors. All the original artist names were prefixed with the word \"by\" so I just had to use the following Regex to extract the text I needed:\n\n```by .*```\n\nI use Sublime Text so this was easy to do and it left me with a long list of artist names. I used Permute Lines > Unique which removed duplicates and I deleted lines that featured the producer's name and it was done in less than 30 seconds. Including the opening of 9 pages and swapping between tabs, maybe a minute, tops. I'm pretty fast with SF and Python but I know it would have taken more than double that time to get it all done.\n\nNow that might not be the case for someone more versed in any of the other techniques I listed. But the point was finding the quickest solution for a small task and writing code or engaging with technology that needed extra input didn't feel like the right thing.\n\n## Why automation isn't always the answer\n\n[xkcd has a great comic on this called Automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/) and it features two graphs—Theory and Reality—that demonstrate the time taken vs. work required to write a program that automates a task that you'd take a lot of time on. The theory suggests that you'd get more free time in the end once you've written the code and executed it. But the reality suggests writing code, debugging, rethinking, and ongoing development takes up so much time that you have no time for the original task in the end and you _lose_ time.\n\nMy example doesn't really fit into this as it was a quick task and it wouldn't have taken longer than 5 minutes no matter which solution I chose (the longest, of course, would have been manually copying and pasting each individual name). But it highlighted a problem in automation: when to automate and when to do the rough work yourself. Is the task something that'll take a long time and automation is the better option, or perhaps something you'll need again and again so automation will save time in the long run? I think a script would have been the best option had I wanted to do this again for more producers. Or, because I know the site and I'd only need to find the CSS selectors once, I could remember that and use Screaming Frog in future.\n\nThe goal is knowing what decision to make and that in itself may eat into your free time by trial and error.

But the reality suggests writing code, debugging, rethinking, and ongoing development takes up so much time that you have no time for the original task in the end and you \u003Cem>lose\u003C/em> time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My example doesn’t really fit into this as it was a quick task and it wouldn’t have taken longer than 5 minutes no matter which solution I chose (the longest, of course, would have been manually copying and pasting each individual name). But it highlighted a problem in automation: when to automate and when to do the rough work yourself. Is the task something that’ll take a long time and automation is the better option, or perhaps something you’ll need again and again so automation will save time in the long run? I think a script would have been the best option had I wanted to do this again for more producers. Or, because I know the site and I’d only need to find the CSS selectors once, I could remember that and use Screaming Frog in future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The goal is knowing what decision to make and that in itself may eat into your free time by trial and error.

So here it is.\n\n## Tools of the trade\nFor the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I'm prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.\n\nThe things I use are:\n\n* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)\n* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/)\n* [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/)\n* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/)\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)/~~[Grav](https://getgrav.org/)~~\n* [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)\n\nIn terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use ~~[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)~~ [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress ~~and Grav~~, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay £3/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I'll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.\n\nIn total, it costs me about £140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.\n\n## The process\nI run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can't update everything as regularly as I'd like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:\n\n1. I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly\n2. If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)\n3. If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)\n4. If I don't want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard\n5. I use a special Python script to decide what to write about\n6. I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site\n7. I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don't write about it, I just put the link on there)\n\n## The Python script\nIf you're not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it's purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!\n\n[Raindrop has its own API](https://help.raindrop.io/collections/) which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my Collections. Here's the code:\n\n~~~\nimport requests\nimport random\n\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE'}\n\nr = requests.get(\n'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens', headers=headers)\n\nresponse = r.json()\n\nraindrop_list = []\n\nfor num in range(0,len(response[\"items\"])):\n\tcount = response[\"items\"][num][\"count\"]\n\ttitle = response[\"items\"][num][\"title\"]\n\ttitle_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))\n\traindrop_list.append(title_count)\n\traindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]\n\nrand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)\nprint(raindrop[rand])\n~~~\nI'll explain each line.\n\n`requests` gives me access to the API and `random` is for the random pick, which I'll explain in a second.\n\nI set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.\n\n`raindrop_list` is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. `('Food & Drink', 7)`)\n\nI create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called `count` and the title in `title`.\n\n`title_count` creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and `count`.\n\nEach `title_count` gets added to `raindrop_list` and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called `raindrop` which gets rid of all the empty Collections.\n\nFinally, I create a random integer between 0 and `len(raindrop_list)-1` and use that as the random index of `raindrop` which gets printed out.\n\nMake sense? Probably not as that's the first time I've ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don't get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.\n\nAs for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis is a flow that works for me and I'm almost certain it won't work for anyone else. That's because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don't have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!\n\nBut the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you're done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just... stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I'm done.","src/content/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow.md","150bbdd90333020e",{"html":5376,"metadata":5377},"\u003Cp>A few months ago, I “revealed” my content creation flow on Twitter (as if it was a secret) and I said I’d write about it in more detail.

Women in SEO are still the best\n\nThis still hasn't changed from last year or the year before.\n\nI'm especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.\n\nAnd a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of [B-DigitalUK](https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk), Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, [Crystal Carter](https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/), Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.\n\n### 2. SEOs really love experts, huh?\n\nTwo things. 1) I'm honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I'm not an expert. That's okay to say as it isn't a binary construct of \"OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\" on one end and \"I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER\" on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That's how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).\n\n### 3. Many at the top don't really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do\n\nI'll be writing a follow-up to my piece on [Being Black in Digital Marketing](https://www.adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/), looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I'm by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can't help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we're back where we were as a community. I'm neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I've had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don't really want diversity in SEO, don't know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!\n\n### 4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps\n\nSince my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is [AI](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/), particularly [machine learning](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/). I'm not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with [AGI or artifical general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.\n\nI've also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I'd love that one day. Manifesting!\n\n### 6. Python is still amazing and I'm getting back into it.\n\nI released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct [WatSERP script](https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/) that I will eventually reupload in the future). [Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post](/posts/introducing-ralts/).\n\n### 7. I love Google Search Console\n\nAfter three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It's all about that granular data!\n\n### 8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!\n\nSince moving away from IBM Watson [for moral reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II), [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There's plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.\n\n## Content and Links\n\n### 9. I'm fine with not being good at link building\n\nLink building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I'll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!\n\n## Misc\n\n### 10. You shouldn't \"live and breathe marketing\"\n\nThere's a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say \"don't do this\" and \"you must do that\" in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don't if you don't. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.\n\n### 11. Outside of work, I'm a LESSEO\n\nI will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don't optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn't completely unoptimised but not to the point where I'm focusing on ranking.\n\nI chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate. I'm not Bruce Wayne/Batman to the industry.\n\n### 12. I love the Web, SEO as a discipline, and a select few people but I really don't like the industry.\n\nI tweeted that just over 2 years ago. I've alluded to some of the reasons in this post but there's a lot of nonsense and noise out there that you have to sift through to get to the things that make sense. \n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to:\n\n- Ruth Everett\n- Ronke Lawal\n- Surena Chande\n- Saffron Shergill\n- Azeem Ahmad\n- Areej AbuAli\n- Tatiana Mac\n- Jess Peck\n- Lauren Roitman\n- Sophie Gibson\n- Sophie Darr\n- Dave Smart\n- Jamar Ramos\n- Olivia-Mae Foong\n- Lucy Robinson\n- Natalie Arney\n- Petar Jovetic\n- Charlie Norledge\n- Dan Taylor\n- Daniel Liddle\n- Marco Giordano\n- Chloe Ivy Rose \n\nAnd loads of other people I've not mentioned who have made my third year as an SEO a great one.","src/content/posts/third-year-professional-seo.md","544bfaebd2726401",{"html":5405,"metadata":5406},"\u003Cp>Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (\u003Ca href=\"/posts/first-year-professional-seo/\">read about my first year here\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/posts/second-year-professional-seo/\">my second year here\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here is what I’ve learnt in my third year as a professional.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"people\">People\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-women-in-seo-are-still-the-best\">1.

No. It was all risk-taking, followed by resilience and admiration for getting back on the horse and trying again. They also had a shitload of money and privilege behind them. Those five men have had the luxury to make bad choices - which have affected people’s lives - and get away with them. Look at Elon Musk calling someone a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/unsworth-vs-musk-pedo-guy-defamation-trial-verdict.html\">“pedo guy”\u003C/a>, being taken to court for defamation, and \u003Cem>getting off\u003C/em>.

Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!\n13. Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything\n14. Don't listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it's slow or it won't get you a job. They're not that cute, their hair's uneven, and they look dusty.\n14a. Also don't listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you'll \"fall behind\". There are plenty of \"experts\" making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential.

After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren't relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I'd have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it\n16a.

I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn’t an issue; “I’m okay with rock music, I just don’t love it”. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone’s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I’ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What’s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.\n\nThe first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he’d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.\n\nI liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn’t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton. There was no real reprieve here other than totally removing myself from the group and the music. The latter came quicker than the former and left me hoping I’d never hear that music again.\n\nAnd I did a good 4 year run, until this year. Thankfully, no MCR but the rock returned and this time, there was no negative association attached. Why? Because the person that brought it back was my girlfriend. Now, when it comes to music, I can be quite snobbish at times. I tweet about rubbish artists and their lack of talent and regard for decent melodies everyday. But when your girlfriend is involved, you have to really stop and think. And listen. So I had a choice: either continue down the route of disliking anything remotely heavy when it came to rock or accept there was a problem and try and remedy it. The vote was unanimous (well, after a few initial criticisms but she’s so lovely, I couldn’t really continue with them) and I chose to give rock music one last go. I started easy with bands I liked on a basic level: Muse. I already liked Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. I listened to Absolution and quite enjoyed it. As they were one of her favourite bands, that was an easy win. Gave Paramore a go (well one song) and really liked Ignorance. Starting to get better.\n\nThe bigger test was the Foo Fighters. Now, I felt the same way about them as I did with Muse, ie. they’re alright. Always knew Dave Grohl was cool, so that helped. On my way to London today, I listened through their latest album, Wasting Light. Knowing there’d be some hard stuff on it, I was a little apprehensive. The contemplation of memories flooding back of college and the emo phase. I played through it anyway… and I wasn’t disappointed. In fact, I was hooked after just 20 seconds. Not one bad track on the whole album (which I will review this week). I don’t have anything to really compare it to (yet), but it really blew me away. I was bobbing my head to the parts that I was worried about. For the first time in my entire life, I was loving a rock album. It was all thanks to my girlfriend, who inadvertently gave me the determination to break the stigma I had attached to the second biggest genre in popular music. I was already hating current pop music (another genre I may have to try and immerse myself in for the same reason) and with rock, I was hating on about 70% of all popular music.\n\nBut not anymore. I probably should have done this years ago. I would have had more people to relate to and share feelings with on how awesome the albums were, but it’s better late than never. Rock needn’t be about people moshing or thrashing about on guitars making nothing but discordant noise – that’s what death and speed metal are for (controversial). I’m pleased to have embraced a genre that I had ignored for many years and I’m looking forward to discovering new bands and albums, not only from rock but its other sub-genres and other genres I’ve been sleeping on.

I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn’t an issue; “I’m okay with rock music, I just don’t love it”. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone’s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I’ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What’s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he’d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn’t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to.

But this one comes from his second alter-ego, Shrill Evans. It's a sub-20-minute journey through jazz and classical beats from the 18th century all the way to the present day. Shrill Evans' name takes inspiration from Bill Evans, the late jazz pianist who was classically trained at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music in New York. MONOLITH is a nod to him and the music that fuelled his prolific career. The album was produced, mixed, and mastered by Shrill himself, using his trusty SP-303 for added grit. Fans who download the album will get an exclusive bonus track of Shrill Evans live at The Ternhill Grove in Bradford, his one and only performance back in 1995. ✝ for jazz * for classical","monolith.jpg",["Date","2019-04-29T23:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith","src/content/music/monolith.md","db102eb600f71fad",{"html":6420,"metadata":6421},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":6422,"imagePaths":6423,"frontmatter":6424},[],[],{"title":6412,"linerNotes":6413,"pubDate":6425,"image":6414},"30 Apr 2019","monolith.md","nighttime",{"id":6427,"data":6429,"body":6434,"filePath":6435,"digest":6436,"rendered":6437,"legacyId":6443},{"title":6430,"linerNotes":6431,"image":6432,"pubDate":6433},"NiGHTTiME","Dedicated to late night TV.","nighttime.jpg",["Date","2020-08-21T23:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime","src/content/music/nighttime.md","f833831a8020aa99",{"html":6438,"metadata":6439},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":6440,"imagePaths":6441,"frontmatter":6442},[],[],{"title":6430,"linerNotes":6431,"pubDate":215,"image":6432},"nighttime.md","mumbo-jumbo",{"id":6444,"data":6446,"body":6451,"filePath":6452,"digest":6453,"rendered":6454,"legacyId":6461},{"title":6447,"linerNotes":6448,"image":6449,"pubDate":6450},"Mumbo Jumbo","noun: language or ritual causing or intended to cause confusion or bewilderment.","mumbo-jumbo.jpg",["Date","2018-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo","src/content/music/mumbo-jumbo.md","9b2e62ee57272712",{"html":6455,"metadata":6456},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":6457,"imagePaths":6458,"frontmatter":6459},[],[],{"title":6447,"linerNotes":6448,"pubDate":6460,"image":6449},"11 Nov 2018","mumbo-jumbo.md","nomad",{"id":6462,"data":6464,"body":6469,"filePath":6470,"digest":6471,"rendered":6472,"legacyId":6479},{"title":6465,"linerNotes":6466,"image":6467,"pubDate":6468},"NOMAD","nomad /ˈnəʊmad/ noun a member of a people that travels from place to place to find fresh pasture for its animals and has no permanent home. a person who does not stay long in the same place; a wanderer.
