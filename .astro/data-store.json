It is also intended as a complement to this site's description of the principles of \u003Ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220709170602/http://www.provenanceunknown.com/edit/basics.html\">copywriting for the web\u003C/a>.\n\nThis document does not offer a comprehensive guide to usage, nor is it intended as a replacement for such guides as the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chicago-Manual-Style-Univ/dp/022628705X?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&inkId=ae0a61b81e6f4877f5afc51eeda3b05f&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Chicago Manual of Style\u003C/a> or the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Associated-Press-Stylebook-2022-2024-ebook/dp/B0B72HTS37?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&linkId=fae8770c1306762a8e4be7cd6f59b5b7&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Associated Press Stylebook\u003C/a>. But it is a living document, and with luck it will grow into a useful guide to written communication over the web.\n\nThe standards set herein are my own, though they owe a debt to other style guides I have seen, and to my experiences using them. Certain conventions (\"web\" and \"website,\" for example) reflect predominant usage online more than any personal preference on my own part, however.\n\nYou are free to use this style guide for any personal purpose; however, if you wish to excerpt any part of it elsewhere, please include an attribution and link to this site. Thoughts, suggestions and reactions of any nature \u003Ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220127234244/http://www.provenanceunknown.com/about/contact.html\">are welcome\u003C/a>.\n\n\u003Cb>Note:\u003C/b> This is only a guide. Hopefully, most of its conventions will\nserve you well, but you may find some that you don't like, or that don't\nfit your writing style. Different writing styles demand their own particular\nrules, both online and in print. If any of the conventions described here\ndon't suit your purposes, do not hesitate to adopt your own.\n\n\u003Ch2>First principles \u003C/h2>\n\nIf clarity and economy of expression are prized in print, they are doubly so on the web.\nReaders have short attention spans for web copy, and most designers have a penchant\nfor small text sizes, making text harder to read. And, on many critical\npages on a site, space for text is often at a premium.\n\nObserving just a few guidelines can go a long way toward ensuring you can be easily understood:\n\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Get to the point. Use short words and phrases, rather than longer ones, and omit unnecessary words.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Keep it simple. Express one thought at a time, and use plain language.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don't use metaphors, figures of speech, technical jargon or other writerly flourishes, unless\nthey help make a point.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Resist using sarcasm and irony; and when you find you can't resist, say so.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Let your readers know when you are stating your own opinions. When you state a fact,\ntell them where you got it from.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n\u003Ch2>Specific conventions \u003C/h2>\n\nConventions commonly observed when writing and editing web copy are listed below.\nFor terms and conventions not specified here, standard references include\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/\">Merriam-Webster's 10th Collegiate Dictionary\u003C/a>,\nthe Associated Press Stylebook and the\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\">Chicago Manual of Style\u003C/a>.\n\nWithin this style guide, accepted abbreviations indicate abbreviations\nthat should be used on every reference, unless a term needs to be spelled out\nfor sake of clarity. Acceptable abbreviations can be used at your discretion.\n\n\u003Cb>acronyms\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>Use all caps for acronyms of two to four letters, except for\nletters that represent prepositions or determiners (a, an, or the).\nFor example, for the Museum of Modern Art, write MoMA. In general,\nuse initial caps for acronyms five letters and longer. For example,\nNasdaq. There is one exception (documented here, so far): WYSIWYG.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>agreement\u003C/b>\n> Words referring to aggregates of individuals are treated like any other word\n(i.e., agreement is determined by whether the word is plural or singular). For example,\nThe San Francisco Giants are going to win the pennant; They are going to win the pennant;\nThe team is going to win the pennant.\n\u003Cbr>\n> Company names that are written in plural form take singular verbs and pronouns. For example, Cisco Systems is headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Generally, you can distinguish the two cases by introducing the word 'the' in front of the name in question. For example, The Giants are going to win the pennant. Not: *The Cisco Systems are headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Company names generally take the neuter pronoun it. For example, Microsoft restated its earnings.\n\n\u003Cb>a.m., p.m.\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nSee \u003Ca href=\"#datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/a>.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>bulleted lists\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nIntroduce a bulleted list with a colon. For example,\nThere are a number of things to keep in mind when writing a style guide:\n... Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each bulleted item. Bulleted\nitems must be parallel in construction. End bulleted sentences with periods (not semicolons or commas),\nand do not punctuate the end of fragments.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>capitalization\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary capitalization. Only capitalize job titles if they precede\nthe title holder's name. For example, Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch.\nDo not use all-caps for company names unless the name is an acronym.\nFor example, IBM, One Touch Systems Inc. (not *ONE TOUCH Systems Inc.).\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>company names\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nAvoid unnecessary punctuation and symbols in company names. For example,\nYahoo, CNet, E-Trade Securities, Avanti.\n\nWhere a company name is spelled with an initial lowercase letter,\ndo not capitalize the name at the beginning of a sentence. For example, eBay.\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb>dashes\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nUse em-dashes (either coded as a dash (—) or typed as two hyphens (--))\nto set off distinct thoughts within a sentence. In general,\ntry to rephrase your thoughts to avoid this construction. Where used, treat an em-dash as a word,\nwith a space on either side. For example, No one disputes that Thom —\nwho spells his name with an 'h' —\nis a totally rad dude.\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n\u003Cb id=\"datesandtimes\">dates and times\u003C/b>\n\u003Cblockquote>\nLocal conventions for specifying dates vary. To avoid ambiguity,\neither specify a date's month by name or letter abbreviation, or use the international standard\ndate notation, yyyy-mm-dd. For example, Feb. 24, 1998, or 1998-02-24.\n(A summary of the international standard for date and time notation is\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html\" title=\"A Summary of the International Standard Date and Time Notation\">here\u003C/a>.)\n\nSpecify time of day by either using a 24-hour clock or omitting the seconds\nand using a.m. and p.m. For example, 17:15:23, or 5:15 p.m.\nNoon is 12:00:00 or 12:00 p.m.\n\n\nIn general, include the relevant time zone abbreviation when specifying the time of day.\nTime zone abbreviations are capitalized and separated from the time by a space.\nFor example, 10:54 a.m. ET.

Express one thought at a time, and use plain language.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don't use metaphors, figures of speech, technical jargon or other writerly flourishes, unless\nthey help make a point.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Resist using sarcasm and irony; and when you find you can't resist, say so.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Let your readers know when you are stating your own opinions.

For example, Cisco Systems is headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Generally, you can distinguish the two cases by introducing the word 'the' in front of the name in question. For example, The Giants are going to win the pennant. Not: *The Cisco Systems are headquartered in San Jose, Calif. Company names generally take the neuter pronoun it.

WordPress has [post formats](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/post-formats/) that can facilitate that. They are:\n\n* aside: like a note\n* gallery: a gallery of images\n* link: a link to another site (great for [linkblogs](/linkblog/))\n* image: a single image\n* quote: a quote\n* status: a status update, similar to a tweet\n* video: a video or video playlist\n* audio: an audio file or playlist\n* chat: a chat transcript\n\nMost of these I probably wouldn't much if at all but status intrigued me. I already use asides on all of my blogs front page but I wanted something different for those quick quips or musings. Because a lot of modern WordPress themes don't come with post formats out of the box, you have to enable them so I added this to my theme's functions.php file:\n\n```php\nadd_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'POST_FORMAT_NAME' ) );\n```\n\nThen you have to create a template for your format(s) (unless your theme has them already) and that's where I had to get really creative. Here's what a Bluesky post looks like:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/bluesky-post.jpg\" alt=\"a bluesky post by me that says bleh\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nTo get that working, I wrote a function in the template-tags.php file in my inc folder that retrieved my author name, my website (since it was also my Bluesky handle), and my avatar. All this info was accessible via the `get_the_author_meta()` function:\n\n```php\nfunction status_author() {\n    $author_avatar = get_avatar( get_the_author_meta( 'ID' ), 64 );\n    $author_name = get_the_author_meta('user_firstname') . ' ' . get_the_author_meta('user_lastname');\n    $url_cleanup = array(\"https://\" => \"\", \"/\" => \"\");\n    $author_url = strtr(get_the_author_meta('url'), $url_cleanup);\n    echo '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta\">' . '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta-avatar\">' . $author_avatar . '\u003C/div>' . '\u003Cdiv class=\"status-author-meta-text\">' . '\u003Cspan>' . $author_name. '\u003C/span>' . '\u003Cspan>' . '@' . $author_url . '\u003C/span>' . '\u003C/div>' . '\u003C/div>';\n}\n```\n\nI also added a bit to get rid of the URL scheme and all the slashes. Nice and neat! Then, I added the status_author() function to my template file (content-status.php):\n\n```php   \n\u003C?php if ( is_single() ) : ?>\n        \u003Ch1 class=\"entry-title\">\n            \u003C?php print_post_title(); ?>\n        \u003C/h1>\n\u003C?php else : ?>\n    \u003C?php status_author(); ?>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"byline-text\" style=\"margin-bottom:1rem;\">\n        \u003C?php the_content(); ?>                 \n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003C?php status_posted_on(); ?>\n\u003C?php endif; ?>\n\n\u003C?php if ( is_single() ) : ?>\n    \u003Cbr>\n\u003C?php endif; ?>\n\n\u003C?php \n\nif ( 'post' === get_post_type() ) : ?>\n\n\u003C?php\nendif; ?>\n\u003C/section>\u003C!-- .entry-header -->\n```\n\nWhat this says is to check if the page is a \"single\"—like a blog post—and if it is, add the title, otherwise add the status author info, the status text, and the date it was posted. I added some CSS to make mimic the Bluesky post design:\n\n```css\n/* please don't roast my CSS, I'm not a web dev!!! */\n\n.status-author-meta, .status-author-meta-text, .status-author-meta-avatar {\n    display: flex;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta {\n    margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text {\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    margin-left: 1rem;\n    letter-spacing: 0.25px;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text span:first-child {\n    font-size: 1.25rem;\n    font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-text span:nth-child(2) {\n    font-size: 1rem;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta-avatar img {\n    border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta + .byline-text a {\n    font-weight: 700;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n.status-author-meta + .byline-text a:hover {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n```\n\nAnd \u003Cspan lang=\"fr\">voilà\u003C/span>!\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/status-post.jpg\" alt=\"a wordpress status post that says 'imagining a world where SEGA still made hardware and they battled with Nintendo in the 2000s and 2010s for handheld dominance'\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\nOf course, how I put this together was specific to my setup and theme but the fundamental techniques are universal:\n\n* add theme support for formats\n* write the functions to get the author data\n* output it in a template\n* style it with CSS\n\nReclaim your status updates!","src/content/morsels/morsel-12.md","e45357d2d689d32f",{"html":1162,"metadata":1163},"\u003Cp>Even though I’ve deleted Twitter, I miss just throwing a thought out into the ether.

Here's a command example:\n\n`py yt.py -u \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"`\n\nBut I'm lazy and wanted something I could just access online. [Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs) already has a thumbnail grabber but it displays all thumbnail sizes. I just need the biggest (as I used them for featured images on my blogs) so rather than copy, I decided to use Google's [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) to generate the code.\n\n_**Please note**: I have looked through the code, tested it, and rewritten some of it as not to just copy and paste AI-generated content. However, if you see any non-stylistic issues with the code, please let me know._\n\n_**Update: 21st Dec 2024**: it looks like YouTube has killed the maxresdefault image so I've replaced it with hqdefault.

You also can't submit an empty field either as it will warn you.\n\nThe reason I used AI for this is because I was trying to recreate code that I'd written elsewhere and it wasn't working and I could foresee losing hours and hours of my life when I could just get a large language model to do it and check the work.\n\n\u003Cscript>\n        const form = document.querySelector('#youtube-form');\n        const thumbnailContainer = document.querySelector('#thumbnail-container');\n        form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            const youtubeUrl = document.querySelector('#youtube-url').value;\n            const videoId = extractVideoId(youtubeUrl);\n            if (videoId) {\n                generateThumbnail(videoId);\n            } else {\n                document.querySelector('#thumbnail-container').innerHTML = 'Invalid URL, try again! :(';\n            }\n        });\n\n        function extractVideoId(url) {\n            const regex = /^(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:youtube\\.com\\/(?:watch\\?v=|embed\\/)|youtu\\.be\\/)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})/;\n            const match = url.match(regex);\n            return match ? match[1] : null;\n        }\n\n        function generateThumbnail(videoId) {\n            const thumbnailUrl = `https://img.youtube.com/vi/${videoId}/maxresdefault.jpg`;\n\n            const img = document.createElement('img');\n\n            img.src = thumbnailUrl;\n\n            thumbnailContainer.innerHTML = '';\n            thumbnailContainer.appendChild(img);\n        }\n    \u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cstyle>\n    #thumbnail-container {\n        margin: 1rem 0;\n        font-size: 2rem;\n        font-weight: 700;\n    }\n\u003C/style>","src/content/morsels/morsel-13.md","66544cc6b57635de",{"html":1203,"metadata":1204},"\u003Cform id=\"youtube-form\">\n    \u003Clabel for=\"youtube-url\">Enter YouTube URL:\u003C/label>\n    \u003Cinput type=\"text\" id=\"youtube-url\" name=\"youtube-url\" required>\n    \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">Grab that thumbnail!\u003C/button>\n\u003C/form>\n\u003Cdiv id=\"thumbnail-container\">\u003C/div>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>A while back, I made a YouTube thumbnail grabber for my Terminal using Python.

The code in question was this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cmeta http-equiv=\"Status\" content=\"401\">\n```\n\nThe idea was to use this as a replacement for server-side code to serve a 401 status code. I initially said \"yeah, sure\" until I took a second look and realised I'd not seen the `Status` value before.\n\n## meta http-equiv\n\nA quick thing on http-equiv. It's an attribute that simulates an HTTP response header (equiv is short for 'equivalent') and is mostly used for things called meta refreshes where the page refreshes or redirects on the client's side instead of the usual server-side refresh/redirect (like a 3xx status code). In that case, it'd look like this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cmeta http-equiv=\"refresh\">\n```\n\nIt's generally recommended not to do this for redirects but if you don't have server access, it's a close-enough substitute for the user, even if the UX isn't ideal.\n\nIn the case of `http-equiv=\"Status\"` it looked familiar but not _quite_, hence why I had to take a second look. A quick Google returned one exact result but it wasn't from MDN or even W3Schools. [It came from Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/meta_http-equiv_status):\n\n> meta http-equiv status is an HTML extension specification that adds the \"Status\" value to the existing meta element's http-equiv attribute as a method for representing the HTTP Status code to be returned by a web server serving that HTML document, and for consuming applications like webmention receivers to parse and interpret as such for use-cases such as representing a 410 Gone deleted resource on static hosting that often disallow setting HTTP headers directly.\n\nThis sounded fair in theory but when I checked the only example in the doc, it returned a 200 status code instead of a 401. What's more, the requirements were quite specific, both for the server and the \"consuming application\". Because of all these factors, I figured it wasn't a feasible solution.\n\nAnother thing to note: server activity happens before page load so offering a status _during_ page load won't work. It's too late by then and this will miss the mark. As you saw above, meta refreshes only _simulate_ server responses and would cause issues for users coming from a search engine expecting one page only for it to refresh on load. If the 401 was to work, the page would load as normal—serving a 200—and then suddenly give a 401 error page (with or without the code).\n\n## A word on 410 vs. 404\n\nA 404 status code tells a server the resource in question could not be found. There are a number of reasons why that might be the case but the main ones are that the page was removed or the URL was incorrect in someway. A 410 status code tells a server the resource in question is permanently gone (literally). Now you might be thinking why we use 404s if we delete pages when 410 is probably more appropriate. If you deleted, it's gone, right? Well, 404 is a softer default. You could delete something and decide to reinstate it and it's easier to bring it back to the same URL and have a search engine pick it up and reinstate it to the index. But a 410 is meant to be a permanent goodbye.\n\nIf you really to nuke a page, 410s are objectively better and quicker to get picked up by Google and dropped from the index ([but by a negligible amount, according to John Mueller](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-john-mueller-clarifies-404-410-confusion-for-seo/513576/)). However, in most cases, 404 does the job. What's more, 404 is better supported with CMS's and other frameworks as they usually offer templates and functionality to serve them should a page gets deleted. 410s tend not to have the same level of support so you may have to create this routes and pages manually (if you even have access to do so). And you might not even see the difference once you have.\n\nSo yeah, if you're getting traffic from a regularly visited external link and that page was deleted and it's causing server issues, go for a 410. Otherwise, 404 works just fine.\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n  \u003Cp>I'm likely to be missing some nuances, exceptions, and quirks of 410s, as well as the http-equiv I've quoted.

For example, if I put my name in (Luke Davis), it would return an HTML list saying \"Auke Davis\", \"Cuke Davis\", \"Duke Davis\" etc. But I'd also get names like \"Fluke Davis\" and \"Spuke Davis\".\n\n## Why did you make this?\n\nI saw a friend's Bluesky name was a variation of \"bell hooks\" which led me to think of something for Tony Hawk. I ended up with \"Phony Hawk\" and realised it'd make a funny nickname for a Pokémon called Gholdengo which uses a golden surfboard to travel around. Then I wondered, what if you could generate a list of names with the first part replaced for meme purposes.\n\nIdeological rabbit holes are fun!\n\n## How the code works\n\nI used the base of the [Thumbnail Grabber](/morsels/morsel-13/) so when you submit a string, the script checks if anything is there and replaces the first letter the string with each letter of the alphabet. It also matches the casing, whether that's upper or lower case. Finally, it outputs it in a neat HTML list.\n\nIn terms of JavaScript, there are ```querySelector```'s to grab the value of the input and add it to the output element and two functions for swapping the first letters (including a nested ```flatMap``` with a regular ```map``` inside).\n\nI did use AI for the nested ```flatMap``` as I couldn't figure out how to replace the first letter which suggested I need to learn that pattern better but everything else was a mix of reworking what I made before and using StackOverflow lol\u003Csup>[\u003Ca href=\"in-1\">1\u003C/a>]\u003C/sup>\n\n## How this could be improved\n\nI'm sure something will come up but feel free to [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/starchildluke/astro/issues) if you have any suggestions!\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n    \u003Csup id=\"in-1\">1\u003C/sup>This is \u003Cstrong>NOT\u003C/strong> \u003Ca href=\"/posts/some-genuine-thoughts-vibe-coding/\">vibe coding\u003C/a>, mainly because AI use was for one function because I couldn't figure it out but also because I was very conscious about what I was coding.)\n\u003C/IcebergNotes>\n\n\u003CSwapped />","src/content/morsels/morsel-23.mdx","6a0d12678d53a331","morsel-23.mdx","lists",["Map",1590,1591,1612,1613,1639,1640,1660,1661,1680,1681,1709,1710,1729,1730,1749,1750,1803,1804,1824,1825,1900,1901,1920,1921,1941,1942,1961,1962,1981,1982,2001,2002,2022,2023,2044,2045,2065,2066,2089,2090,2110,2111,2130,2131],"about-you-video-games",{"id":1590,"data":1592,"body":1598,"filePath":1599,"digest":1600,"rendered":1601,"legacyId":1611},{"title":1593,"description":1594,"published":38,"pubDate":1595,"tags":1596},"About You: Video Games","Another video games list, but more about me this time.",["Date","2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"],[1597],"gaming","* Favorite Game of all Time: Pokémon Silver\n* Favorite Series: Pokémon\n* Best Soundtrack: Golden Sun (closely followed by Sonic R)\n* Favorite Protagonist: Sonic\n* Favorite Villain: Bowser\n* Best Story: Pokémon Black 2/White 2\n* Have not played but want to: Final Fantasy VII\n* You Love Everyone Hates: Pokémon Sword/Shield\n* You Hate Everyone Loves: Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum\n* Best Art Style: Pokémon Legends: Arceus\n* Favorite Ending: Mario 64\n* Favorite Boss: Wario\n* Childhood Game: Super R.C.

It was directed by Albert Pyun and stars a cyborg trying to free himself from the life as a cop and the police demanding he do one last job. It's chaotic, a mess, and absolutely fantastic. At first, I was like \"okay, this isn't too bad\" and then there were two scenes that elevated my enjoyment. One involved an old woman getting harassed by a robot, only for her to pull out a gun from her bag and shooting it to death. Damn, granny! Then there was a fight scene with the main character sliding down a muddy chute and fending off a robot and it was incredible. I'm very tempted to watch it all again. The plot itself is lacking and the dialogue is objectively awful but that all adds to the film's charm and I don't think Pyun was trying to make an Oscar winner here. Instead, he won my heart.\n\nIn contrast, my least favourite was another Pyun movie called Postmortem. It started Charlie Sheen in the lead role and it just felt like a feature length episode of Taggart (IYKYK), both for the subject matter and the fact it was set in Glasgow (it was originally meant to be set in San Francisco; talk about a switch up!)\n\nI also watched Animalympics for the first time in about 25 years and that was really cool and funny. I still knew the words to the songs (thanks, brain!)\n\n## Games\n\n### Pokémon Platinum\n\nI started my playthrough a few months ago and I finally finished it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted. It cemented my opinion that the original Sinnoh games were vastly overrated and I wish Gen 8 hadn't been dominated by them so much.\n\n### Pokémon White\n\nAfter finishing Platinum, I had the choice of BW or XY. In the end, I chose White despite having completed Black and Black 2 already this year but I needed to give the generation one last chance to see if the first games were really that bad. The difference here is that I'm playing White on an emulator and the graphics are so much better. I might actually enjoy the game this time!\n\n## Videos\n\n### yr fave film critic\n\nMy friend Dom has a podcast series called [yr fave film critic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G) where he talks about film news, what he's watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It's so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)\n\n### Law & Order clips\n\nI watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said \"here, have some more\" and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn't conducive to good mental health. But the clips were good!\n\n## Music\n\n### Robert Palmer\n\nNowhere near as much as the weeks before but I still listened to Addicted to Love, I Didn't Mean To Turn You On, and You Are In My System amongst others\n\n### Corinne Bailey Rae\n\nAnother amazing artist from West Yorkshire, Corinne Bailey Rae's new album Black Rainbows is amazing. It has some rock, some punk, R&B, electronica, classical, all of it. And her voice sounds sublime. Amazing range, you should definitely check it out.\n\n**Other music you should check out**:\n\n* Eddie Chacon - Sundown\n* Quantic - Dancing While Falling\n* Halibab Matador - Souvenirs\n* thxk_u - B.O.B\n* earfluvv & aroma - Sonic Oddities\n\n## Books\n\nNo books again this week.

Julia Roberts's voice was so relaxing as Charlotte and Steve Buscemi played a great rat as Templeton.\n\nI revisited the Happy Death Day series for the first time in a while and had a bit of a 90s film bonanza for the rest of the month, starting with Street Fighter (RIP \u003Cspan lang=\"es-PR\">Raúl Juliá\u003C/span>), doing the original Mortal Kombat double for the first time, revisiting Nemesis and Heat, and finally ending with My Life, a poignant movie about life and how we can craft it through a series of misunderstandings but change them at any given moment.\n\n## Games\n\n### Dragon Quest VIII\n\nI wanted to try a DQ game that didn't tie me to the PS4 but also wasn't one of the 16-bit games, and since VIII is so highly regarded, I went for that. I initially tried this on PS2 but the frame rate was so bad on the emulator (even on a Pixel 5), that I went for the 3DS version and it's been great with the voice acting and the mechanics. Again, I don't mind the grind as much especially with speed up and it's not like Pokémon where you don't necessarily need strategy (compared to VGC).\n\n### Dragon Quest XI S\n\nSeeing how good this looked on PS4, I decided to get a PS4 Pro just so I could play it. Yes, it was already on Switch but I don't regret the decision but it looks and plays amazingly and it's a game I'm co-oping with my son which adds a unique element to it all. The voice acting is stellar, I actually enjoy the cut scenes for once, and it's just a gorgeous game so far.\n\n### Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince\n\nI picked this up as a promotion treat and I've loved it so far. It has all the charm of the previous DQM games and the mechanics are so easy to get lost in. I love being able to speed through battles as grinding is a pain in any RPG. I know there are supposed to be frame rate issues later on but I've not reached that part yet and, having played Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for a year and a half, I'll cope!\n\n### Dragon Quest Builders 2\n\nThis was supposed to be a game my son and I could play together but he didn't like all the talking so I've played a bit on my own. Not as much as the others but it's been enjoyable. Minecraft meets Dragon Quest, what's not to love?\n\n## Videos\n\n### yr fave film critic\n\nMy friend Dom has a podcast series called [yr fave film critic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G) where he talks about film news, what he's watched, and answers viewer/listener questions.

We watched them in reverse order but it didn't matter as they were pretty standard hero-in-peril-saves-the-world movies. Nice animation, nice action.\n\nAlien: Romulus was... not great. As I said on Letterboxd:\n\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\t\u003Cp>This film felt underbaked. Also not a fan of the Black \"guy\" getting abused so often.\u003C/p>\n\t\u003Cbr>\n\t\u003Cp>I think about how well The Thing portrayed distrust and cabin fever and I'm watching this movie and those themes were treated like difficult problems to solve and this is the best they could come up with. Didn't feel particularly original and it generally pissed me off.\u003C/p>\n\t\u003Cbr>\n\t\u003Cp>In the words of Peppermint, \u003Cq>have I seen it? Girl, I want to \u003Cb>un\u003C/b>see it.\u003C/q>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\nBut on the plus side, it made me appreciate Prometheus and Covenant more (which isn't saying much).\n\nAnd finally Despicable Me 4 was really good; better than I expected and it finished with Everybody Wants To Rule The World by Tears for Fears (which we both sung along to 🥹)\n\n## Games\n\n### Breath of Fire IV\n\nI've been playing this for the last few weeks and I've really enjoyed so far. I love the isometric view and the pixel art graphics, which make it feel more like a GBA game than a PS1 game but that doesn't diminish its quality. I'm following along with a speedrun video and according to that, I'm about halfway through the game.\n\n### Dragon Quest XI S\n\nStill playing, still enjoying it.\n\n## Videos\n\n### Gronya\n\nGotta give a shout out to Gronya, a Dragon Quest content creator I've been watching for a while but recently I started watching her streams and joined her Discord.

I want to experiment, make mistakes, improve and evolve. The following creatives have helped me with that in the past and they're worth keeping an eye out for in 2017.\n\n## 1. RKZ\n\nRKZ is a very good friend of mine and a staple follow on every social media platform. A fantastic photographer, musician and thought provoker, he has definitely made me consider my own creations. I still need to get a photoshoot done (when I'm not Grade A broke!)\n\n[Website](https://rkzuk.com) | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rkzuk) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rkzuk) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rkzuk) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/rkzuk)\n\n## 2. Arkotype\n\nI'm simply in awe every time I see a new project from Arkotype, the \"passion project\" of graphic designer Dan Clarke. His brand of video games-related work breathes new life into a lot of material with iconic status of its own, from Pokémon to Legend of Zelda. As someone who pursued a career in graphic design, this would have been my go-to place for inspiration and in some ways it is now.\n\n[Website](https://arkotype.co/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arkotypeco)\n\n## 3. Alex Stewart\n\nI went through a rough period in the middle of 2015 and during that time, I took to writing to take my mind off things. I remember reading Alex Stewart's Moneyball series on The Set Pieces where he took Bristol City on Football Manager and rode them to glory in Europe with a sustainable financial strategy based on the books [Moneyball](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3710/9780393324815), Soccernomics and The Numbers Game. I nicked his idea for Championship Manager and he retweeted the articles and that's how I started using my current Twitter account. Aside form that, Alex is a brilliant writer and television broadcaster, following in the footsteps of his father Alastair Stewart.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AFHStewart)\n\n## 4. Liam Wong\n\nI love media that looks like other media - drawings that look like photographs and vice versa. Liam Wong toes the line between photography and painting with his ['Tokyo Nights' (TO:KY:OO) project](https://www.liamwong.com/book). Keeping a minimal colour palette, his lighting effects give the impression of impeccable illustration and lead you to ask whether you're looking at a fantastic drawing or a brilliant photograph. He was recently named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list if you needed any more evidence of his high credentials.\n\n[Website](https://www.liamwong.com/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/liamwon9/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/liamwong)\n\n## 5. Jer'Maine\n\nI have to thank my good friend Stephanie Vaughn for the conection. It's no secret that people of colour are disenfranchised in the tech world, despite their incredible innovations. Jer'Maine is a software engineer, photographer, designer and creator of DatCode, a blog and group for black coders to engage and share their work. Apart from being a brilliant coder and man of tech himself, the group has been an awesome way to a marginalised group to collect their thoughts and become better coders, people and representatives in a discipline that ignores their efforts on a grander scale.\n\n[#DatCode](https://gitdatcode.github.io/)\n\n## 6. Nguyen Le\n\n[Roger Federer](/jardim/sport/roger-federer/) fans unite! I stumbled upon Nguyen Le while browsing on Dribbble and I was immediately drawn to a personal project dedicated to my favourite tennis player. His attention to detail and minimalist style spoke to me and I've been following his work ever since. He runs a design course which I would happily join (again, if I wasn't poor.) In terms of art/design direction, Le is the man you should be paying attention to in 2017.\n\n[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/newincreative)\n\n## 7. KUMA GOLD\n\nI can't speak highly enough of KUMA, particularly for the fact he has made trap music audible for me. His production style is close to my own in some ways and I think that's where I feel the kinship so strongly. Of course, he is much better than me which helps when I want to be improve myself and while I think he deserves a lot more recognition or even a deal, you know what? A deal might taint the output - not because I think he would falter (NEVER that) but I've seen major-ish deals sour free creativity. He is embarking on a world trip and that will only further his creativity and produce even better music. I can't wait.\n\n## 8. The Music Snobs\n\nIt's been a while since their last episode but nobody does music critique better than The Music Snobs. I feel honoured to be in contact with the team - Arthur, Isaac, Snoop and Jehan - and welcome every opportunity for a conversation about our favourite artists. Their opinions don't always align with mine but I have a great respect for them and their articulation is second to none. Forget all those publications telling you what you should think about music and just listen to these guys and who they recommend for the craft.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/totalmusicsnobs)","src/content/posts/10-inspiring-creatives-2017.md","9789d4fed1505364",{"html":2474,"metadata":2475},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>(This page contains Bookshop affiliate links where I receive a small profit for every sale.)\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This year, I want to increase my creative output.

There have been a couple of instances in the past few weeks where I've noticed journalists and influential figures tweeting their thoughts, receiving a backlash and the classic \"I was misunderstood, but what did I expect from Twitter?\" retort. Well, what _did_ you expect?\n\nOf the two examples I can remember, one involved someone supposedly being \"misinterpreted\" and claiming \"if you don't say it exactly on here Twitter, people will interpret it for what they want. Because people are stupid.\" (That's a direct quote by the way.) The second was the tweet Steve Martin sent in tribute to Carrie Fisher, who sadly passed away a few days ago.

No matter what the intentions were in that tweet, it doesn't read well to me and obviously not to hundreds who read it. That's not a coincidence and neither are many tweets and online messages sent out over the past year and beyond. So here's a tip for anyone with an important message to send in 2017: don't do it on Twitter. You only have 140 characters per tweet and if it can't retain a sensible context within those parameters, choose another medium. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - there's another place for your comment and Twitter is definitely not it. But the problem is that square peg has been poorly carved to fit and caused problems for the writer and the readers. Sometimes, those thoughts have been prejudiced anyway so there's no chance of an alternative perspective - it's just bad.\n\nAnd that's precisely why we need some nuance this year. I feel like I've overused that word and it's lost all meaning but it's a social requirement for 2016. Binary constructs need taking down. Sexuality, race, religion, and politics are all fluid ideas. Nuance is necessary in discussing and understanding them. When it comes to racism, it's very important to take subtle differences on board when unravelling the troubles PoC face in their adversity. Intersectionality might seem like a millennial buzzword to you but it's not and needs to be taken seriously. Ignorance of those social modulations lead to further harm and given who's getting inaugurated in a few weeks, we need as much protection as possible.\n\nBut where does brevity come into play? It can come in conflict with nuance when a broad topic comes into question. Even this article could be more concise after I've edited and published it. I think brevity is important for 2017 because online media in particular has suffered with linguistic saturation and an obsession with narrative. I recently wrote an unpublished article called [Football Is Dead](https://lastwordonsports.com/2017/01/13/football-is-dead/) where I rang the death knell on the sport thanks to its replacement: The Narrative. There's a lot of focus on talking and writing over the actual event and it isn't confined to the annals of sport. The news is overflowing with jargon, unnecessary words and ill-thought ideas. I've had to block The Guardian on Twitter because the opinion pieces coming through were terrible. I couldn't believe they got past an editor, both in context and general grammar and construction. My best writing has come from an academic perspective, where both brevity and nuance are crucial tools. I wouldn't have got a First for my dissertation without them. We need those tools for what we read and hear in 2017.\n\nThis won't dumb down journalistic output as some may suggest. Active writing can still flourish with care for succinctness and understanding of social differences. In fact, these ideas will bolster the messages needed. A clearly constructed message along with the follow through of action and education are vital in this fight against rising fascism. Trump and his ilk don't know the meaning of brevity and nuance. Publications like Inf0wars and Br3itbart are overflowing with offensive and confused rhetoric and because we're in a culture of more is better and they shout it the loudest, it's taken in by so many. That's not to say the direct opposite is what we need - talking quiet and saying nothing never solved anything.

So here I am.\n\nI wrote an article called [2017 Needs Brevity And Nuance](/posts/2017-needs-brevity-nuance/) 7 years ago and while I still think we need both, I want something else in 2024—and mainly for me.\n\n2023 has shown me how impatient we can all be and I've definitely felt that thrown in my direction this year. It has caused me stress, anxiety, and exhausted me beyond belief. Sometimes, it was an urgent need for my time or expertise where panic was unwarranted. Or where I struggled with something and needed someone to be patient with me, but got the opposite. With my [ongoing journey through autism](/posts/probably-autistic/) and neurodivergence as a whole, I've noticed things I do that people can find difficult to deal with: mainly how I communicate and my issues with decisiveness. I'm not trying to be weird or make things hard for people; my brain just gets in the way of the best or simplest solution. But while I navigate that, I need people to give me time and space to get there rather than feel like I'm an inconvenience, being weird, or acting like a child. In hindsight, my neurodivergence has been around for decades and I've had to learn how neurotypical people act and respond accordingly. So I'm not a weird kid—I'm an adult who just needs some patience to get to where we all want to go.

I went to my first CBT sessions back in 2017 (it was a pivotal year, evidently!) and assertiveness was something that cropped up a lot as something I needed. Elements of it have improved, particularly in work, but I could still do a lot better. In fact, I've arguably _regressed_ in certain areas of my life; backing down rather than saying something. I say it's to conserve energy and while that's true, there may have been times where I could have dealt with issues better if I'd been assertive rather than passive (or aggressive, another annoying go-to of mine). It's easier said than done but setting boundaries, being firm in them, and not backing down—even if there are uncomfortable conversations and reactions involved—is ultimately for the best.\n\nUltimately, I know people see me in a certain way and I have no intention of changing the things that they see. But knowing people treat me differently because of them, in a way I can see and feel, makes me sad. It's not about wanting to be normal or \"not me\" (been there, done that), it's about a wish for patience from others and for people to maybe stop and think about how they act and the impacts those actions have. Wherever we are on the everchanging planes of neurodivergence, we could also use a bit of care and time to ponder and reflect and make life a bit easier to deal with.

With my \u003Ca href=\"/posts/probably-autistic/\">ongoing journey through autism\u003C/a> and neurodivergence as a whole, I’ve noticed things I do that people can find difficult to deal with: mainly how I communicate and my issues with decisiveness.

But while I navigate that, I need people to give me time and space to get there rather than feel like I’m an inconvenience, being weird, or acting like a child. In hindsight, my neurodivergence has been around for decades and I’ve had to learn how neurotypical people act and respond accordingly.

I also keep up to date on Feedly by following like-minded blogs. I share found content on social media or republish it on my blogs. You can make this a specific \"excellence\" series of posts, share as a piece of celebratory news, or make it part of post series. Ensure you credit the original article and depending on your link building strategy, send the relevant parties an email to let them know you've mentioned them.\n\n## Hot Tops → Main headlines/hot news/gossip/etc. in your sector\n\nThis is one of my favourite parts of The Read and, depending on what you write about, it could fit into your blog profile. Again, research is key and while there are similarities with celebratory news, this is more specific in being about hot news your reads **must** know about. Beware if you write about celebrities or media-centric topics not to be slanderous or offensive towards other parties to avoid penalties or takedown warnings.\n\n## Listener Letters → Q&A\n\nThis might be something more suited for publications with a large fanbase. Give out your email address and ask for questions. This can look like a How To guide, an \"agony aunt\" column, or an interview with the writer about the publication. The world is your oyster. If you do write about personal topics, keep names anonymous when requested and try to be sensitive.\n\n## The Read → Opinion pieces, rants, critiques\n\nOp-eds turn social media users into foaming frenzies for the right or wrong reasons. I've had to block news publications online due to their terrible opinion pieces. But you needn't write pieces of this ilk. This is a make-or-break part of your strategy. You can either garner a fanbase or alienate your best readers with a post of this nature. Research is **paramount** here. Link back to sources and be clear in your message. I've written pieces on cultural appropriation and it's important not to enable the criticism in your own writing. It undermines your credibility and makes you look like a hypocrite. If you don't feel comfortable writing this kind of piece, you could tweet your thoughts on Twitter but follow the same rules as above. These posts can take time to plan which can be difficult when news and its relevancy comes and goes in the blink of an eye. But they will come back. Your topics needn't be about discrimination either. Talking about a sporting legacy, or the impact someone has had a community can follow on from your celebratory articles mentioned earlier.

The journey from the airport to my hotel was as smooth as it had ever been the other 3 times I'd done it. I still marveled at having 4G underground. We stayed at the same hotel as before: Lisbon City Hotel. Our room was smaller than last time but big enough for what we needed: somewhere to chill and sleep. And we got a balcony which my partner took full advantage of.\n\nSince we got there early afternoon, we managed to have lunch at a place we'd visited the year before called Tapas n' Friends. The food was delicious and I practically inhaled everything, along with an espresso martini! When in Lisbon and all that. We then went shopping in Baixa-Chiado and I got a zipped jumper and some records. It'd been years since I'd gone crate digging so I relished the opportunity. The two LPs I got were Clues and Riptide by Robert Palmer.\n\nFor dinner, we hit a spot we visited last year called Pizza Wizard. My partner was eager to go back as was I and the pizzas did not disappoint. Great crusts, great dough, great toppings. I only had a few slices as I wasn't super hungry but it was enough and we left satisfied. \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">Obrigado\u003C/span>, Pizza Wizard!\n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/crispy-mafya-burger.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a chicken burger on a plate, covered in shredded cheese\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nOur first full day. We had breakfast, the classic continental breakfast with our favourite panpipe music playing on the speakers; it's become our thing now.\n\nWe decided to go to [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/) after missing it last year. Because they were redecorating the modernist section, we explored the main building which housed classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. The grounds are an homage to early 20th century modernism and Brutalism with its extensive use of concrete. My partner walked around and pointed out the various plants and we discovered one we'd never heard of before (the West Indian Lantana\n). We also had a drink and some \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">pastéis de nata\u003C/span> at the main café before we explored the art.\n\nWith time to kill, we took the Metro down to the coast and walked across to Cais do Sodre but before we did, we stopped off at a restaurant called Bel Forno. Great pizza and even better sangria that my partner enjoyed. Afterwards, we reached the Praça do Comércio and enjoyed the space and the sculptures around us before we stopped to watch a street performance (I will add their names once I find them!) It was very entertaining!\n\nOnce it was over, we made our way back to our hotel to rest before one final trip out for dinner to a place called Crispy Mafya. It's a fried chicken restaurant and, unlike last year, I was ready to have a proper meal. I had a \"New York Burger\" and it tasted so good. The ambience was super chill, even with occupied tables, and the music was perfect with a heavy slant on UK hip hop, grime, and drill (Giggs was on maybe three times? You love to see it!)\n\nA very cultured day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMonday started with a trip to Belém and an attempt to visit the Jerónimos Monastery. However, despite Google claiming it was open all day on Mondays... it wasn't (I've sent them proof so hopefully they change it so others don't make the same mistake). We took some photos and walked across to the Centro Cultural de Belém to see what happened to the old Museu Coleção Berardo (now called [MAC-CCB](https://www.ccb.pt/en/macccb/)). However, it was also closed on Mondays which I didn't realise until writing this just now 🤦🏽‍♂️\n\nWe took a long-ish walk across the main road to a little café/restaurant by the River Tagus (Rio Tejo) so we could eat and I could pee (lol). We both had a burger and chips with a ginger ale. Living the dream! The main reason for crossing over to the riverside was to visit MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology) and it had some new features since we visited last year. The biggest change was the renaming of the three sections of the museum, now called MAAT Garden, MAAT Central, and MAAT Gallery. MAAT Gallery had some new exhibits with art from Joana Vasconcelos, Mário Cesariny, and pieces from the Carmona e Costa Foundation Collection, Portugal's largest private collection. I really enjoyed the various art and my partner ADORED it, especially the textiles from Joana Vasconcelos's exhibit. I loved seeing her eyes light up 🥰\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/valkyrie-octopus.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a tentacular textile sculpture called Valkyrie Octopus\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Tentacular and spectacular!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nIn the evening, we went to our favourite restaurant: Atalho do Cais. For me, it has quintessential Portuguese/Brazilian vibes in terms of ambience and decor. But the food hails from different lands, serving a mix of Iberian meats and Japanese sushi dishes. The star of the show was the wagyu beef carpaccio that my partner might have loved more than me by the sounds of things 😂 but again, I was happy to see her so happy and enjoying the food and the atmosphere like I was. I had some fancy garlic bread, another burger, and a chocolate cake for pudding.

It was the first time I'd been back since 2017 much to the faux-disdain of my partner who \"supports\" Benfica, a decision heavily influenced by their star striker, Gonçalo Ramos. The stadium also has the Alvaláxia shopping centre attached to it so we walked through there (I'd done the same before the match I went to in 2017) and then walked around the outside until we reached the team shop. I spent a long time browsing for things to get and in the end, my partner bought me a new shirt and a tracktop as an early birthday present and I got a notebook and pin for myself.\n\nFor dinner, we wanted to go back to Pizza Wizard but they weren't open, sadly. But their loss was another restaurant's gain as we had dinner at Anarchia. Again, gorgeous decor and delicious food. I wanted all their cutlery and crockery! Afterwards, we ambled back to the hotel, which wasn't far from the restaurant, and waited for 12:00am to clock over so I could usher in another year of my birth!\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/partner-oceanario-de-lisbon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"my partner looking at the sharks and fish at the Oceanário de Lisboa\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Beauty in nature\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nMy sixth birthday spent abroad, my fourth in Lisbon, and my second with my partner - but what to do?

We'd planned to go to the Oceanário de Lisboa again as we went last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. But i also wanted to visit the nearby Vasco do Gama shopping centre before heading down to our birthday dinner spot called Las Ficheras.\n\nOceanário de Lisboa was amazing, as expected. We traversed the different biomes, full of marine life both flora and fauna, before heading to the café for lunch. I had a pasta salad and apple crumble for dessert.

I got a few goodies from Fnac before heading back to the hotel to rest and making it back out to Las Ficheras for dinner. I had a quesadilla for main and a chocolate \"mousse\" for dessert (it wasn't as airy as expected but it was still sweet and tasty).\n\nOne of the best birthdays I've had in a while.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/cow-santa-outfit.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"a cow dressed in a santa outfit\">\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Boo?

Except there _is_ a problem: companies need to recoup the money they lost during the pandemic, and what better way to do that than to **not** pay employees who need pay rises and instead completely replace them with language models they can tinker with at the fraction of the price. If those writers are lucky, they might stay on but have an increased workload (for no extra pay) involving editing \u003Cabbr title=\"large language model\">LLM\u003C/abbr> outputs rather than writing copy from scratch.\n\nThat's the situation we're in and will continue to be in while AI is seen as the first port of call to any kind of problem. By taking a step back, you can see the wider picture and realise that there are a multitude of options that come **before** opting for AI. Here are just a few:\n\n* Ask yourself truthfully if there's even a problem to solve\n* Pay your damn people and let them work if there is\n* Consider a programmatic approach where applicable (this comes with similar caveats to AI use so don't fall down a similar trap)\n\n## I object/subject!\n\nOf course, none of this is to say \"don't even THINK about AI\"&mdash;I'm not a conservative&mdash;but instead think before you leap into something that could cause harm, and arguably is already. Testing stuff is cool and recommended. That's why I built Oapy with a mirror of OpenAI's Playground tool. Give this [prompt engineering](/posts/prompt-engineering/) thing a go, read up on how it really works, and see what sticks and what doesn't. A great article I read a few weeks ago by Mitchell Hashimoto called [Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting\n](https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-transactional-prompting) touches on the objective and subjective nature of prompt design and where our LLM use cases fall. I'd found issues with using LLMs for generative purposes despite using all the techniques I'd found from language tech professionals. But Mitchell suggests that these use cases fall in the subjective category and that makes them hard to test for accuracy:\n\n> If we have an input that can produce an objectively correct (or I'd even argue \"mostly correct\") output, then prompt engineering can be successfully applied. Examples of problems with objectively correct results: information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\n> However, if we have an input that produces something subjectively correct, then prompt engineering is much less useful. The best example of subjective results are creative tasks such as art generation, writing, semantic search.\n\nOf course, people will&mdash;and should&mdash;argue that prompt engineering has helped improve creative tasks. But that also, arguably, requires the practioner to have a good understanding of their niche. A very good artist or writer with enough knowledge of what they want and how to achieve it via prompt engineering will get the results they need. It won't need testing either as they'll just know based on experience. But someone looking to cut costs and maximise profit will assume you say some magic words and press a button and it'll just happen because the AI bros said so and they're never wrong.\n\n## Cases where AI could be better\n\nMy main argument for AI as a last resort is stronger for those subjective channels of generation. However, with the objective channels such as \"information extraction, classification, limited forms of code generation etc.\" (ie. most NLP problems) AI can go further up the pecking order. That's because tools for these tasks have existed for years and have shown varying levels of success. If they work for you, perhaps you don't need to consider AI at all. But if you need improvements or can't afford to pay for these tools (a better cost-cutting measure than firing writers I'd say), AI would be a good consideration. That's because language models in particular are very good at solving NLP problems, with minimal training or supervision. For example, my [RALTS classification tool](/posts/introducing-ralts/) uses [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) with [zero-shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) and the results have been good enough that I'd never want to fine-tune it. Here's how it classified this blog post:\n\n![A plot showing different classification categories for this post, analysed by a large language model.

Some were very good at the aforementioned objective NLP tasks and not so good with content generation, and vice versa. We obviously have ChatGPT and GPT-4 now, as well as a growing number of open source models built of those commercial models, and those gaps are getting smaller by the day. But there isn't truly a one-size-fits-all model yet and, despite what anyone is telling you, we are no closer to AGI and I don't think we ever will be so stop talking about it, okay?!\n\n## Being conscious with my conscience\n\nI've been the main guy at work when it comes to AI. I talk about it a lot, I try to show the best use cases, I've even done a webinar on it. But I also show the potential risks and harms of the tech as well because it's not all interesting and amazing. I worry that the former will outweigh the latter in people's perceptions and I'll be the one responsible. That could be unfounded but who am I to say?\n\nI also worry I come off as a hypocrite. I do believe there should be some kind of pause and some kind of regulation but I don't agree with the [open letter](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) that likes of Gary Marcus and Elon Musk signed _because_ Musk was involved, which despite Marcus's claims should be scrutinised given his [practices](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done) and [intentions](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23687440/elon-musk-truthgpt-ai-chatgpt); this isn't a [The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point](https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-worst-person-you-know-just-made-a-gr-1825121606/) moment). I also worry that a regulatory committee will be whitewashed and cause further harm to the women in AI who have been advocating for better ethics for years.\n\nI don't have any concrete answers to the problems I see in AI but I do know that I want people to be safe.

Not in an apathetic way but frozen still because this is what we have right now. We're days away from Donald Trump's *second* term as president.

I co-ran a webinar on generative AI last year and I've offered opinions on it at work and in industry publications. But over time, I feel a growing pang of regret. All of this shit is destroying the planet and making the worst people richer and more powerful. And for what?

I don't take pride in it, which likely sounds cheap and meaningless now. So what? The damage has been done.\n\nAnd it's not just generative AI. It's tech in general. I just don't know if I'm helping in my line of work in a morally meaningful way. Am I just making other people richer? Am I making the world a better place or helping regular folk (ie. non-business owners)? And if I try to offer recommendations to do that, will they be heard? Why does everything need a business case anyway? Why can't we just help people without needing evidence? In the words of Edward Nygma at the end of Batman Forever, there's too many questions.\n\nSo I guess this stream of consciousness boils down to needing answers in 2025. Because none of this is sustainable. Tech can't keep getting away with this and I need to figure out how to do better in this awful and very real landscape. It's not \"like\" a horror movie. It's not \"like\" a dystopia. It's all happening.

They're singing from the same hymn sheet","They have their pros and cons but they're not directly opposed. The key difference is manual fine-tuning.",[686,281],["Date","2025-07-13T23:00:00.000Z"],"import IcebergNotes from '../../components/IcebergNotes.astro';\n\nA while back, I read [Max Woolf's article on how he uses LLMs](https://minimaxir.com/2025/05/llm-use/). In it, he explained how he prefers to use the API directly vs. a customer-facing chatbot (e.g. Gemini.com, ChatGPT, et al):\n\n> [...] I never use ChatGPT.com or other normal-person frontends for accessing LLMs because they are harder to control. Instead, I typically access the backend UIs provided by each LLM service, which serve as a light wrapper over the API functionality which also makes it easy to port to code if necessary. Accessing LLM APIs like the ChatGPT API directly allow you to set system prompts which control the “rules” for the generation that can be very nuanced. Specifying specific constraints for the generated text such as “keep it to no more than 30 words” or “never use the word ‘delve’” tends to be more effective in the system prompt than putting them in the user prompt as you would with ChatGPT.com. Any modern LLM interface that does not let you explicitly set a system prompt is most likely using their own system prompt which you can’t control: for example, when ChatGPT.com had an issue where it was too sycophantic to its users, OpenAI changed the system prompt to command ChatGPT to “avoid ungrounded or sycophantic flattery.” I tend to use Anthropic Claude’s API — Claude Sonnet in particular — more than any ChatGPT variant because Claude anecdotally is less “robotic” and also handles coding questions much more accurately.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of prompt engineering as a concept or how it has been made to be a scientific skill and then refashioned/evolved to become context engineering but unfortunately, it's a requirement while much of the technology's inner workings are obscured.\n\n## A rebuttal\n\nToday, I read a counterargument by Morgan alias SansGuidon who [prefers chat interfaces and conversational interactions over API access](https://morgan.zoemp.be/conversation/):\n\n> For me, chat interfaces aren't just convenient—they’re an essential part of understanding [...] Max argues APIs allow for more fine-tuning—system prompts, temperature control, constraints. Sure. But in a chat session, you can iterate, switch topics, revisit past decisions, and even post-mortem the entire conversation, as a way to learn from it and log your decisions.\n\nMost of the piece makes chatbots seem like portals to broadened humanism vs. the cold inaccessible reality of APIs which, in his words, are \u003Cq>fine for deterministic output\u003C/q>.\n\nI agree with Max Woolf's advocation for API access vs. chatbot access in that I have the means of fully testing how the LLM works in certain conditions. I can change the [temperature](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-temperature) whether I need deterministic _or_ probabilistic outputs. The temperature is often warmer by default on a chatbot and that's a commercial thing: LLM providers want people to feel like they're talking to a machine that almost seems human and creative. But then people try to use chatbots for one of the most deterministic actions on the internet: search.\n\n## Hot takes, cold facts, and human-regulated temperatures\n\nIf I want to a factual answer and I ask ChatGPT for the answer, it may get it right because the training data had the answer the the probabilities were aligned to give me that answer. And yes, we have grounding now to help, but for more obscure information, it'll give me a wrong answer or completely confabulate\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#in1\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> it. Temperature might not help there but at least I won't get a response that sounds like a try-hard who keeps apologising for getting the wrong answer. What use is that?\n\nA lot of the thinkpieces that advocate for the _humanish_\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#in2\">2\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> qualities of chatbots are devs who aren't necessarily knee-deep in machine learning work. Vibe coding has messed with a lot of heads, making people think that the perfect prompts will make the perfect apps in less time than without them. But the truth is that LLMs can't teach you anything more about the world and your craft than real humans who are already in it and have been doing this stuff for years. We're replacing what we have for an abstraction of what we have and if speed isn't the focus, as SansGuidon mentioned in his article, we're replacing the journey of discovery via human-to-human interaction—the very thing that gives life meanings—with a faulty proxy of that and pretending it's the same or somehow better. And that's very dangerous.\n\nUltimately, neither approach can replace just asking a human how to do a lot of things. I use the API and still get crap and either give up and look at Stack Overflow or put something rough together. But chatbots and APIs aren't polar opposites—they're all singing from the same hymn sheet. You just don't get to change the font size on one vs. the other.\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n\t\u003Cp>\u003Csup id=\"in1\">1\u003C/sup> I prefer to use confabulate instead of hallucinate to dehumanise AI actions.

It was something I just accepted before I entered the industry but I’ve been here for over 3 years now and I know I’m not the only one here.\n\nSo for this article, I spoke to some of the Black marketers who offered their thoughts 3 years ago, as well as some new ones, and asked them if they felt much had changed since then.\n\n## Participants\n\n* Jamar Ramos ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamarramos))\n* [Trevor Price](https://www.tvtrevphotography.com/)  ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorprice89))\n* Zenia Johnson ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeniajohnson))\n* [Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence](https://honeybeehome.co.uk/)  ([LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/melissa-reynolds-lawrence-232b1b32))\n* Clarissa Ankrah\n\n## What is office life like, 3 years later?\n\nI referenced Black representation in digital marketing in relation to microaggressions and “the experience starting and stopping at being a minority”.\n\nFor Jamar Ramos, there have been some marked improvements but racism still persists—albeit from a different source:\n\n> “Pre-2020, office life was terrible. I hated traveling 60+ minutes to get to, and leave, the office. I hated dealing with multiple meetings that could have been emails. I hated ignoring so many racist comments passed off as ‘jokes.’ Post-2020, the travel was better, the meeting load was the same, and the racist comments/jokes came from clients instead of coworkers.”\n\nHe elaborated on that, showing that microaggressions are still prevalent in the SEO space in particular: \n\n> “Clients consistently asked me what I did for the company, even though in email correspondence and on our company website, it was clear what I did. Now that I’m job hunting, the hoops I have to jump through and the consistent focus on the SEO aspects I don’t know intimately are very bothersome. I’ve also been told that a role I’d been recruited for was off the table because the company didn't have the budget for hiring anymore, only to watch that same company hire a white dude a few weeks later. All those black squares didn’t lead people to mirror their words to their actions.”\n\nPhotographer [Trevor Price](https://msha.ke/tv_trev/) hasn’t seen much change outside of COVID safety:\n\n> “Office life pre and post 2020 has more or less been the same save for some house keeping regarding covid safety practice. It has been pleasant but not necessarily pleasing if that makes sense. Office culture in my experience rarely changes as it has to be a major shift in the way a business operates for that to happen. For any successful business, the old adage of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind, however with industries unintentionally (or in some cases intentionally) dominated by a white (usually male) workforce they may not realise the system is broken until it’s too late.”\n\nClarissa Ankrah didn’t feel supported when she joined the industry in a few years ago:\n\nI really enjoyed having the flexibility to work abroad and take regular trips back to attend office days. It gave me a good sense of balance to connect with the team and explore new surroundings.\n\nHowever, starting a new field of marketing was challenging, and I sometimes found it difficult to seek support from my manager. I also found myself code-switching as the only black woman working for the company.\n\nFor Black women, the microaggressions are still more acute and stronger. In an article by Daphna Motro, Jonathan B. Evans, Aleksander P.J. Ellis, and Lehman Benson III entitled ‘[The “Angry Black Woman” Stereotype at Work](https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-angry-black-woman-stereotype-at-work)’, they looked at how the racist trope pervades office life in the US and prevent Black women from speaking out against discrimination:\n\n> “[...] Studies show people in organizations believe Black women are more likely to have belligerent, contentious, and angry personalities, an assumption not as readily assigned to other men and women. Recent studies suggest this negative perception is a unique phenomenon for Black women, and the researchers suggest that when Black women outwardly express anger at work, her leadership and potential are called into question.”\n\nAnd [for Black women like Lola Christina Alao](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-women-office-culture), office culture has been a drain, mentally and physically:\n\n> “Black women, like me, are often at a crossroads between wanting to take a stand against microaggressions at work and wanting to fade into the background to protect our peace. Being in the office, for me, meant feeling drained by 3pm, flattened by the weight of endless small talk and the constant pressure to be social, then the exhaustion I felt when I was judged for not wanting to be social.”\n\nZenia Johnson, who offered her opinions back in 2020, said there are pros and cons to working remotely but described some specific disadvantages for Black women:\n\n> “Well, in September 2020 I switched organizations and have been fully remote ever since. In some ways it's been really nice - I get to roll out of bed and go straight to my office, and I don't have a long commute to downtown Chicago so I get to spend more time with my husband and dogs, but also there are some things that I know I'm missing out on. I think this is true for everyone, but for black women in particular the face time that can come by being in office is REALLY important for relationship building and camaraderie. Otherwise, and I say this from experience, some people don't respect your role in the org and question your expertise.”\n\nMelissa Reynolds-Lawrence has seen some positive shifts compared to 3 years ago:\n\n> “Pre-2020, office life was teeming with microaggressions under the guise of 'humour'. I left a job where I felt like the angry black woman narrative was being pushed on me.\n\nPost-2020, the conversations around race are approached more sensitively and Black people that I know feel more comfortable speaking up and pushing back.”\n\n## Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022\n\nIn 2020, I remarked on the lack of Black voices in digital marketing publications and conferences. I have seen a small shift since then, thanks to the likes of Rejoice Ojiaku, Wilhelmina Gilbert-Davis, Anu Adegbola, Miracle Inameti-Archibong, and many more, particularly in the conference space.\n\nLast year, two prominent articles were published regarding the Black experience in digital marketing. The first was by Carla Thomas, former content strategist at Builtvisible, who wrote “[Let’s talk about race and diversity: breaking glass ceilings in digital marketing and beyond](https://builtvisible.com/lets-talk-about-race-and-diversity-breaking-glass-ceilings-in-digital-marketing-and-beyond/)”:\n\n> “2020 is a year that will go down in history. Amongst a swirl of magnifying events around the world, a well-needed spotlight was shone on race and diversity issues.\n\nMore specifically to the creative industries, in July [2020] The Independent reported that a lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the advertising industry leads to stereotyping; stereotyping which often harms society. Putting the importance of needing to reflect a realistic society aside, from a business standpoint diversity is proven to assist with accessing new customers and diversifying a customer base. Although we still have a long way to go, the good news is that the needle on workplace diversity is shifting.”\n\nThen in February 2021, as part of the Black History Month in the US, Adobe wrote “[Being a Black digital marketer in 2021](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/02/19/being-a-black-digital-marketer-in-2021)”. In it, they spoke to a variety of Black marketers about their experiences:\n\n> “Many Black digital marketers talk regularly about “being the only Black person in the room” and how uncomfortable that can feel.\n\n> “Having worked in various offices in my decades-long career, I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t either the only Black person in the office or one of a very small handful,” said Kelly Coleman, executive director of e-commerce at Tarte Cosmetics, where she builds and maintains innovative and effective customer experiences across all of Tarte’s digital properties.”\n\nFor Jamar, who had previous said he “hated being Black in digital marketing”, not much has changed in his outlook:\n\n> “If I could make a career change, I would. I like the money I can make and the people I’ve met. But, unfortunately, the industry talks about moving forward but consistently holds steady. Individuals want to make change, but institutions keep that change at bay.”\n\nMeanwhile, Zenia has felt a shift in how she approaches microaggressions, in that she actively approaches them compared to earlier in her digital marketing career:\n\n> “Having worked in digital marketing for my adult career I've had to work very closely with product and engineering teams - teams that tend to be very male and very white. Early in my career I felt uncomfortable confronting the microaggressions that would be leveled against me, or would question that I was even experiencing a microaggression. To give a few examples, I remember I was managing a team that included a man, and some people would go to him directly for advice or strategy and I was his manager. Or, to give another example (that has actually happened more than once!), when \"soul\" food was catered in the office, I would get a million questions about the greens and whether they were the \"real deal.\" I truly hope that white people have learned not to turn to the black person in the room when they get soul food delivered in the office (but in case they haven't, I'm even more grateful to be remote). Now that I'm a little further along in my career I don't put up with that and call it out when it's happening. I just reached the point where I couldn't code-switch or minimize my own feelings anymore, and I feel totally comfortable confronting a microaggression leveled against me or a junior team member who needs support.”\n\nMelissa also discussed her experiences with microaggressions:\n\n> “Comments about my hair texture. Being pulled up on my tone of voice because simply being friendly isn't enough. I had to overcompensate to be viewed the same as non-Black peers.”\n\nAnd on her general experiences in digital marketing:\n\n> “Generally positive but I am well aware that that's mainly because I'm good at code-switching.”\n\nClarissa’s experience with microaggressions involved use of both Black British Vernacular English and AAVE (African American Vernacular English):\n\n> “A lot of eye-opening experiences stunned me in my first role in digital marketing. I did feel at times that my former manager (a White male) did not know how to converse with me as a black woman. He would have a conversation in his dialect and occasionally would switch to using AAVE with me (I think that's the right term) by using phrases like \"you go girrrl\" or \"girrl\" (in an American accent I might add) to what I can only think to relate or converge with me, conversationally as an employee.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIn another event on a team call, they made a statement in an attempt to try and be \"funny' by saying \"mans a roadman innit?\" (with hand gestures) - everyone but myself laughed on that call. I suppose thinking of the connotations and the demographic of who the media and society label a \"roadman\" it did make me feel very uncomfortable and a small-minded comment to make that can be damaging.”\n\nAnd her experience in marketing:\n\n>“I haven't worked for many digital marketing companies or agencies but since leaving my previous role, matters have definitely improved. Working for a company that is more receptive to feedback to push diversity and support ethnic minorities as well as support their mental wellbeing is something I appreciate.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nContinuous training, mental wellbeing and pushing for diversity should be championed and implemented across the board.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nFor me, I’ve seen shifts but plenty of stagnation. People are still asking Black marketers to make themselves known to conference organisers and people making Twitter and publications lists, solely for the purpose of diversity. The question shouldn’t be how can we improve diversity and that question be left at the doors of Black marketers, it should be “why can’t the most prominent figures in an industry name more than one or two Black people—if that—to promote or offer a space on their panel?” And why are there constant calls for these lists and recommendations with no significant action at a recruitment or company level? What are these lists actually for? The sooner these questions are answered and actions made off the back of them, the better for our experiences.”\n\n## Racial biases in search—technically and personally\n\nIn the paper “[Algorithms are not neutral [PDF]](https://www.catherinestinson.ca/Files/Papers/Algorithms_are_not_Neutral.pdf)”, Catherine Stinson examined the bias found in algorithms and how they undermine people from marginalised groups:\n\n> “People from minority communities have noted that recommender algorithms do not work well for them. Noble documents the ways that search algorithms fail to serve the needs of black women. One of her examples is a hair salon owner who struggled to get her business to show up as a recommendation on Yelp when you search for “‘African American’, ‘Black’, ‘relaxer’, ‘natural”’, as keywords. Complaints about culturally inappropriate recommendations, such as white hairdressers being recommended for those search terms, or Christmas movies being recommended to non-Christians, are common online. Popularity and homogenizing biases may be at fault in those examples. A related issue arises when the recommender system does figure out that a user belongs to a minority group, but overfits to an essentialized version of that identity. That you cannot escape ads for Rupaul’s Drag Race if your online presence reveals any interest in LGBTQ+ issues stems from over-specialization.”\n\n> “There is some empirical evidence for differential effects of algorithmic bias on demographic groups. [...] Zafar et al. discuss “disparate mistreatment”, which arises when a classifier’s misclassification rates differ across social groups. An example (which stems from data bias) is how the COMPAS algorithm made more false positive errors with black defendants, labeling people who would not reoffend as being high risk while making more false negative errors with white defendants.”\n\nIt’s one of those situations where there have been improvements but not enough and not on a wider scale. And it’s something companies like Google acknowledge and state they can’t solve outside of specific use cases that marginalised people draw their attention to. In that case, why should I trust any of the company’s search or wide AI advancements? Won’t they carry racial bias? I’m tired of shrugging my shoulders at the lack of energy to stop harming people who look like me.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, Jamar noted the defence of bigoted rhetoric in relation to [a tweet calling out the male bias of “SEO experts” in a SERP](https://twitter.com/LidiaInfanteM/status/1582352202781569024):\n\n> “[...] when they reply with some tone-deaf argument that women and minorities need to do the work to change Google’s results when you look up SEO experts, racism in the industry is alive and well.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nWe have too many people who think this way and drop some respectability politics into the mentions to defend it. [...] Nothing we do can change the algorithm or the content it scrapes. That change needs to come from the SEOs making the lists and content that Google scrapes. The change needs to come from privileged white males, and this asinine need to make women and minorities do all the work to dismantle their oppression systems.”\n\nTrevor believed, to his knowledge, there had been no major shifts.\n\nZenia concurred:\n\n> “Has much changed? I don't think so. I'm still seeing the same lists published of \"best ppc experts\" or \"top SEOs\" of 2022, and they're all mostly white and mostly men. Conference headliners still skew very white and male. Leadership teams are still white and male.”\n\nAnd Melissa did too:\n\n> “I don't work exclusively in search but I am aware that many panels, conferences and events still centre white males as their most trusted contributors. More still needs to be done in the mainstream events to shine a spotlight on Black professionals in the industry - not because we're Black but because we're talented.”\n\nClarissa said she was disappointed by major brands’ inaction against racial bias until the damage was done:\n\n> “It's not something I noticed in my role at first, but I am aware of some AI presenting racial biases to black people. One thing I read a little while ago was that white content creators were able to monetise hateful terms and Google didn't blacklist this until being prompted to.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIt's very disappointing when big companies brand themselves on being just and prohibiting hateful speech, but not taking systems to block this right away when they clearly have the resources to.”\n\n## Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?\n\nIn 2020, I referenced a piece by Chanda Prescod-Weinstein called [‘Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up’](https://medium.com/space-anthropology/diversity-is-a-dangerous-set-up-8cee942e7f22) where she said trying to use science to analyse and fix racism was a dangerous proposition and that focusing on implicit bias at the expense of explicit bias and its impact could be harmful to the fight for equality. This year, she wrote a follow-up/reiterative piece entitled [‘About your diversity and inclusion requirement’](https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion):\n\n>“I almost feel silly writing this piece because I have written some version of it so many times. I wrote Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up and the Rules of the Diversity and Inclusion Racket. I also wrote long ago about the problems with the broader impacts criterion leading to students of color being treated like diversity props and minoritized scholars shouldn’t be forced to serve diversity.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI wrote, “The diversity racket is this: thinking that this is an intellectual exercise in being magnanimous, not a matter of survival.” I even wrote a whole chapter in my book about unwaged academic housework.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nSo I am tired and feel a bit silly but mostly furious because it is both ridiculous and deeply outrageous that it is necessary to write about this topic again, and surely this will not be the last time.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nBut also, as my grandmother Selma has said to me: I am shocked, but not surprised. Very little about the institutional relationship with “equity, diversity, and inclusion,” “diversity and inclusion,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and it’s newly extra woke iteration “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion” (JEDI, ha! so cute) surprises me. Because the institution’s goal is to survive, not to be better to us or for us. Our survival is not the institution’s goal. Our well-being is not the institution’s goal.”\n\nTrevor suggested diversity needed to be more specific and that more people from non-marginalised groups are speaking out:\n\n> “Honestly it means too many things to too many people. It comes down to the organisation and what fits their environment. If they are recruiting and they find that their applicants all look like clones, there’s likely a problem. The difference post-2020 is that now everyone is noticing it and feels empowered to point it out as opposed to just those affected by the lack of diversity (whether that’s race, gender or disability).”\n\nZenia believes organisational shifts have only been superficial:\n\n> “I think it means that organizations are more aware of the optics - they know what diversity should look like, they know the language to make it seem like they support diversity, but that hasn't resulted in meaningful change. Hiring practices are still the same, and these organizations have largely refused to re-invest in the communities that have been pillaged by decades of negligence and harmful capitalistic practices. The only difference is now there's maybe a DEI meeting once a quarter.”\n\nWhile Melissa wants to see a little less conversation and a little more action:\n\n> “It means almost the same but that people in leadership are being forced to actually pay attention to its meaning and the action. Back your chat, basically. I don't want to hear that you're listening and learning, I want to see that you're providing support, resources and opportunities.”\n\nClarissa believes diversity should be a responsibility at every level:\n\n>“In 2020, in the months of the Black Lives Matter protests, it was a time to bring to light the injustices but also showed support for black businesses, key figures and trailblazers all over the world. It presented the need for allyship and also recognised white privilege and how you can create a community with others by being open and willing to learn about the past, present and future.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI strongly believe that diversity needs to be in all areas, especially seniority. I say this because when their roles involve individuals, their wellbeing and progress, it's empowering and welcomes other perspectives which I believe is key to progression. I believe with a lot of things it's important to be intentional.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nThere tends to be an ongoing concern with performativity in organisations (I see it discussed with Black people I follow on social media) and how it is perceived by others. To me, this means not just speaking out about matters until certain events of the year (i.e. Black History Month) or until others are doing so. I can understand it can be (for a lack of a better word) scary, but it sets precedent for being unapologetically authentic. \n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nAlso, collaborating with others that are positively trying to make the digital marketing space by offering a soundboard for conversations to offer other perspectives is really important. As well as, cultivating relationships to be able to learn from one another.\n\nMy efforts within D&I have certainly evolved over the last 3 years. The Black Lives Matter protests radicalised me more than I expected and I’ve been more active in terms of donations to grassroots organisations and being vocal in the space. I started a newsletter this year that focuses on diversity and inclusivity within recruitment and retention and learnt (and unlearnt) a lot about what D&I should mean. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to bring “diversity” and “inclusivity” out of their buzzword comfort zones and into a reality where:\n\n* Workplaces have marginalised people at every level, not because it makes “business sense” but because marginalised people work too (is there ever a specific business case for employing white British men in the UK?)\n* They can feel safe to work and socialise without fear of micro and macroaggressions which get vehemently defended and subsequently backed up by HR\n* They can choose their own career path that doesn’t involve stunted growth patterns and goalpost shifting when it comes to promotions\n* They aren’t looked to for involvement in diversity and inclusion initiatives purely because they’re from a marginalised background and then made to feel utterly exhausted to the point they have to leave\n\n## What happened to the industry pledges after 2020?\n\nThere were a lot of pledges and responses to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 after George Floyd’s murder. We were told that eyes were opened, people stood with us as Black people, and that our voices would be amplified. But what has that all meant 3 years later?\n\nZenia praised her current employers for their subsequent actions but expressed her sadness at the lack of action from wider organisations:\n\n> “The company that I'm at currently, Outside Inc., has put forth a ton of effort DEI (sic). There is still work to do, but there is investment in third-party resources to continuously grade the organization and hold it accountable. I love that about this company, but I wish it held true everywhere. I have friends of color in the industry - at agencies and in-house, and they've seen very little follow-up to those demonstrative pledges. Yeah sure, you turned the org's social profile pic black, but what happened after that? It just feels so disheartening, and has caused a lot of my friends to divest from participation in DEI initiatives because they're not seeing results or meaningful change. They're doing the work elsewhere - via community organizations, mentorship, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI've also decided to take a break from participation in DEI work at work. Even being at an org that is doing the work well, I'm very tired. Working directly with mentees feels like more actionable and meaningful work for me right now. And to be frank, black folks have always done this work. After the disappointment of the last two years, it's ok for us to step back and take a break. It's time for allies to step in.”\n\nJamar echoed this sadness more strongly:\n\n> “The industry is okay with proximity to equity without any tangible equity being given. Conference lineups look relatively the same, and organizers continue asking women and minorities to nominate themselves for talks instead of doing work to identify new voices. In the months after George Floyd’s murder, I was hopeful the industry wanted to change. Now, I’m sure it doesn’t, and those of us who do will either need to work within a system that actively hates us or find solutions in other industries we might see a warmer welcome.”\n\nMelissa pointed out a need for better mental health support for Black employees:\n\n> “As far as the companies I have close contact with, I definitely see the conversations being continued but I'd like to see more support for Black people's mental health in the industry. Our experiences are uniquely different and so the resources should be too.”\n\nIt’s difficult to see what changes have been made when the pledges haven’t been reassessed a year or two later. [Moz wrote a statement in response to the BLM protests in June 2020,](https://moz.com/blog/black-lives-matter) followed by an update two days later responding to calls for evidence of their existing work. But no other updates since. On a personal level, I know my Twitter DMs were full of messages from non-Black colleagues asking for “sense checks” on statements, guilt, confirmation that I was “seen and heard”. It was very overwhelming and they continued even after I asked for them to stop. But they did eventually and after the dust settled, they rarely spoke to me about anything at all. And that’s how it has felt at an industry level since 2020\\. There are themed months on blogs, icon changes, and then 1st November arrives and it’s back to normal.\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\nHaving read Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s “[About your diversity and inclusion requirement](https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion)”, I empathise with her fatigue. It feels like a constant cycle of Black trauma bringing attention to systemic racism and people and enterprises becoming “aware”, making pledges, and watching the energy disappear over the space of a month. And Black people are always the one doing the work, making things known, and demanding change at every conceivable level whilst experiencing microaggressions, being passed up for promotions, getting fired, or not even finding work.\n\nWithin digital marketing, we’re acutely aware of racial biases in the search engine algorithms but also at an industry level in the lack of Black speakers at marketing conferences and Black marketers in agencies. And it’s not a case of nobody is doing anything but the actions are small and concentrated and can take a very long time to implement. They also need applied pressure—often from Black employees—to avoid them falling into the cracks. Amongst mounting deadlines and a mental health crisis amongst Black communities, it’s difficult to maintain that energy.\n\nSo the question becomes: where do we go from here, and who is “we”?\n\n> “We” should be everyone, regardless of race. That’s because white supremacy affects non-Black people too through non-racial discrimination. Therefore, institutional diversity and inclusion should be the work of everybody in an institution.\n\nA reminder of what I suggested 3 years ago:\n\n1. Actively call for Black candidates for all open roles and hire them\n2. Offer multiple paths for progression\n3. Make intersectionality and inclusion prerequisites of working life\n4. Provide transparency in salaries at all levels\n\nI still believe these things are necessary for Black marketers to feel more comfortable in their roles and places within the industry but I’d like to take it back further.\n\nI recommend everybody reckon with their own biases and the discomfort that comes with it. Too much of this work is obscured by guilt, a need to apologise to Black people for “The Past”, and seeking redemption. It’s not up to Black people to absolve the guilt of others. This defers the grace and space we should all give ourselves to acknowledge and do better. Once we face ourselves, then we can start looking outward and call out the discrimination before us.\n\nAfter that, it’s lifelong learning and action. That’s not the same as the listening and learning we heard incessantly in 2020 that amounted to nothing after the summer. There were plenty of anti-racism book lists published and, for some, those books were bought and left to collect dust on the shelf. The reading is a part of it but it’s not the full work. We also need to be mindful of what biases we perpetuate in our digital marketing. That includes optimising page titles that only say “Black man” or “Black woman” alongside negative stories— write their names . We also need to assess who we work with when it comes to link building. Many of the top news publications have histories of racism. Can we keep overlooking this?\n\nAnd finally, make Black people feel welcome. One of the primary results of microaggressions is to exclude, and often these exclusions are masked as obstacles or barriers of entry that \"affects everyone, regardless of race\". By doing the prior work, we can make healthy, open, and safe environments for Black colleagues to be themselves and grow but also choose not to be involved as is their prerogative. As for those barriers of entry, they need to be checked too, and **before** an incident occurs that causes unnecessary harm or frustration.","src/content/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023.md","01aa26b20ba4c452",{"html":3111,"metadata":3112},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>In a follow-up to my 2020 piece ‘Being Black in Digital Marketing’, I asked the same Black marketers if anything has changed in the last 3 years.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A lot has happened to me since I wrote \u003Ca href=\"https://adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/\">Being Black in Digital Marketing\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I changed jobs, changed roles, and have built something of a reputation in the industry.

It was something I just accepted before I entered the industry but I’ve been here for over 3 years now and I know I’m not the only one here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So for this article, I spoke to some of the Black marketers who offered their thoughts 3 years ago, as well as some new ones, and asked them if they felt much had changed since then.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"participants\">Participants\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Jamar Ramos (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamarramos\">LinkedIn\u003C/a>)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.tvtrevphotography.com/\">Trevor Price\u003C/a>  (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorprice89\">LinkedIn\u003C/a>)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Zenia Johnson (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeniajohnson\">LinkedIn\u003C/a>)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://honeybeehome.co.uk/\">Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence\u003C/a>  (\u003Ca href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/melissa-reynolds-lawrence-232b1b32\">LinkedIn\u003C/a>)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Clarissa Ankrah\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-office-life-like-3-years-later\">What is office life like, 3 years later?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I referenced Black representation in digital marketing in relation to microaggressions and “the experience starting and stopping at being a minority”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Jamar Ramos, there have been some marked improvements but racism still persists—albeit from a different source:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Pre-2020, office life was terrible. I hated traveling 60+ minutes to get to, and leave, the office. I hated dealing with multiple meetings that could have been emails. I hated ignoring so many racist comments passed off as ‘jokes.’ Post-2020, the travel was better, the meeting load was the same, and the racist comments/jokes came from clients instead of coworkers.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>He elaborated on that, showing that microaggressions are still prevalent in the SEO space in particular:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Clients consistently asked me what I did for the company, even though in email correspondence and on our company website, it was clear what I did. Now that I’m job hunting, the hoops I have to jump through and the consistent focus on the SEO aspects I don’t know intimately are very bothersome. I’ve also been told that a role I’d been recruited for was off the table because the company didn’t have the budget for hiring anymore, only to watch that same company hire a white dude a few weeks later. All those black squares didn’t lead people to mirror their words to their actions.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Photographer \u003Ca href=\"https://msha.ke/tv_trev/\">Trevor Price\u003C/a> hasn’t seen much change outside of COVID safety:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Office life pre and post 2020 has more or less been the same save for some house keeping regarding covid safety practice. It has been pleasant but not necessarily pleasing if that makes sense. Office culture in my experience rarely changes as it has to be a major shift in the way a business operates for that to happen. For any successful business, the old adage of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind, however with industries unintentionally (or in some cases intentionally) dominated by a white (usually male) workforce they may not realise the system is broken until it’s too late.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa Ankrah didn’t feel supported when she joined the industry in a few years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really enjoyed having the flexibility to work abroad and take regular trips back to attend office days. It gave me a good sense of balance to connect with the team and explore new surroundings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, starting a new field of marketing was challenging, and I sometimes found it difficult to seek support from my manager. I also found myself code-switching as the only black woman working for the company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Black women, the microaggressions are still more acute and stronger. In an article by Daphna Motro, Jonathan B. Evans, Aleksander P.J. Ellis, and Lehman Benson III entitled ‘\u003Ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-angry-black-woman-stereotype-at-work\">The “Angry Black Woman” Stereotype at Work\u003C/a>’, they looked at how the racist trope pervades office life in the US and prevent Black women from speaking out against discrimination:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“[…] Studies show people in organizations believe Black women are more likely to have belligerent, contentious, and angry personalities, an assumption not as readily assigned to other men and women. Recent studies suggest this negative perception is a unique phenomenon for Black women, and the researchers suggest that when Black women outwardly express anger at work, her leadership and potential are called into question.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And \u003Ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-women-office-culture\">for Black women like Lola Christina Alao\u003C/a>, office culture has been a drain, mentally and physically:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Black women, like me, are often at a crossroads between wanting to take a stand against microaggressions at work and wanting to fade into the background to protect our peace. Being in the office, for me, meant feeling drained by 3pm, flattened by the weight of endless small talk and the constant pressure to be social, then the exhaustion I felt when I was judged for not wanting to be social.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Zenia Johnson, who offered her opinions back in 2020, said there are pros and cons to working remotely but described some specific disadvantages for Black women:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Well, in September 2020 I switched organizations and have been fully remote ever since. In some ways it’s been really nice - I get to roll out of bed and go straight to my office, and I don’t have a long commute to downtown Chicago so I get to spend more time with my husband and dogs, but also there are some things that I know I’m missing out on. I think this is true for everyone, but for black women in particular the face time that can come by being in office is REALLY important for relationship building and camaraderie. Otherwise, and I say this from experience, some people don’t respect your role in the org and question your expertise.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa Reynolds-Lawrence has seen some positive shifts compared to 3 years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Pre-2020, office life was teeming with microaggressions under the guise of ‘humour’. I left a job where I felt like the angry black woman narrative was being pushed on me.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Post-2020, the conversations around race are approached more sensitively and Black people that I know feel more comfortable speaking up and pushing back.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"black-experiences-in-digital-marketing-in-2022\">Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 2020, I remarked on the lack of Black voices in digital marketing publications and conferences. I have seen a small shift since then, thanks to the likes of Rejoice Ojiaku, Wilhelmina Gilbert-Davis, Anu Adegbola, Miracle Inameti-Archibong, and many more, particularly in the conference space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last year, two prominent articles were published regarding the Black experience in digital marketing. The first was by Carla Thomas, former content strategist at Builtvisible, who wrote “\u003Ca href=\"https://builtvisible.com/lets-talk-about-race-and-diversity-breaking-glass-ceilings-in-digital-marketing-and-beyond/\">Let’s talk about race and diversity: breaking glass ceilings in digital marketing and beyond\u003C/a>”:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“2020 is a year that will go down in history. Amongst a swirl of magnifying events around the world, a well-needed spotlight was shone on race and diversity issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>More specifically to the creative industries, in July [2020] The Independent reported that a lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the advertising industry leads to stereotyping; stereotyping which often harms society. Putting the importance of needing to reflect a realistic society aside, from a business standpoint diversity is proven to assist with accessing new customers and diversifying a customer base. Although we still have a long way to go, the good news is that the needle on workplace diversity is shifting.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then in February 2021, as part of the Black History Month in the US, Adobe wrote “\u003Ca href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/02/19/being-a-black-digital-marketer-in-2021\">Being a Black digital marketer in 2021\u003C/a>”. In it, they spoke to a variety of Black marketers about their experiences:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Many Black digital marketers talk regularly about “being the only Black person in the room” and how uncomfortable that can feel.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Having worked in various offices in my decades-long career, I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t either the only Black person in the office or one of a very small handful,” said Kelly Coleman, executive director of e-commerce at Tarte Cosmetics, where she builds and maintains innovative and effective customer experiences across all of Tarte’s digital properties.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>For Jamar, who had previous said he “hated being Black in digital marketing”, not much has changed in his outlook:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“If I could make a career change, I would. I like the money I can make and the people I’ve met. But, unfortunately, the industry talks about moving forward but consistently holds steady. Individuals want to make change, but institutions keep that change at bay.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Meanwhile, Zenia has felt a shift in how she approaches microaggressions, in that she actively approaches them compared to earlier in her digital marketing career:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Having worked in digital marketing for my adult career I’ve had to work very closely with product and engineering teams - teams that tend to be very male and very white. Early in my career I felt uncomfortable confronting the microaggressions that would be leveled against me, or would question that I was even experiencing a microaggression. To give a few examples, I remember I was managing a team that included a man, and some people would go to him directly for advice or strategy and I was his manager. Or, to give another example (that has actually happened more than once!), when “soul” food was catered in the office, I would get a million questions about the greens and whether they were the “real deal.” I truly hope that white people have learned not to turn to the black person in the room when they get soul food delivered in the office (but in case they haven’t, I’m even more grateful to be remote). Now that I’m a little further along in my career I don’t put up with that and call it out when it’s happening. I just reached the point where I couldn’t code-switch or minimize my own feelings anymore, and I feel totally comfortable confronting a microaggression leveled against me or a junior team member who needs support.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa also discussed her experiences with microaggressions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Comments about my hair texture. Being pulled up on my tone of voice because simply being friendly isn’t enough. I had to overcompensate to be viewed the same as non-Black peers.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And on her general experiences in digital marketing:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Generally positive but I am well aware that that’s mainly because I’m good at code-switching.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa’s experience with microaggressions involved use of both Black British Vernacular English and AAVE (African American Vernacular English):\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“A lot of eye-opening experiences stunned me in my first role in digital marketing. I did feel at times that my former manager (a White male) did not know how to converse with me as a black woman. He would have a conversation in his dialect and occasionally would switch to using AAVE with me (I think that’s the right term) by using phrases like “you go girrrl” or “girrl” (in an American accent I might add) to what I can only think to relate or converge with me, conversationally as an employee.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIn another event on a team call, they made a statement in an attempt to try and be “funny’ by saying “mans a roadman innit?” (with hand gestures) - everyone but myself laughed on that call. I suppose thinking of the connotations and the demographic of who the media and society label a “roadman” it did make me feel very uncomfortable and a small-minded comment to make that can be damaging.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And her experience in marketing:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I haven’t worked for many digital marketing companies or agencies but since leaving my previous role, matters have definitely improved. Working for a company that is more receptive to feedback to push diversity and support ethnic minorities as well as support their mental wellbeing is something I appreciate.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nContinuous training, mental wellbeing and pushing for diversity should be championed and implemented across the board.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nFor me, I’ve seen shifts but plenty of stagnation. People are still asking Black marketers to make themselves known to conference organisers and people making Twitter and publications lists, solely for the purpose of diversity. The question shouldn’t be how can we improve diversity and that question be left at the doors of Black marketers, it should be “why can’t the most prominent figures in an industry name more than one or two Black people—if that—to promote or offer a space on their panel?” And why are there constant calls for these lists and recommendations with no significant action at a recruitment or company level? What are these lists actually for? The sooner these questions are answered and actions made off the back of them, the better for our experiences.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"racial-biases-in-searchtechnically-and-personally\">Racial biases in search—technically and personally\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the paper “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.catherinestinson.ca/Files/Papers/Algorithms_are_not_Neutral.pdf\">Algorithms are not neutral [PDF]\u003C/a>”, Catherine Stinson examined the bias found in algorithms and how they undermine people from marginalised groups:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“People from minority communities have noted that recommender algorithms do not work well for them. Noble documents the ways that search algorithms fail to serve the needs of black women. One of her examples is a hair salon owner who struggled to get her business to show up as a recommendation on Yelp when you search for “‘African American’, ‘Black’, ‘relaxer’, ‘natural”’, as keywords. Complaints about culturally inappropriate recommendations, such as white hairdressers being recommended for those search terms, or Christmas movies being recommended to non-Christians, are common online. Popularity and homogenizing biases may be at fault in those examples. A related issue arises when the recommender system does figure out that a user belongs to a minority group, but overfits to an essentialized version of that identity. That you cannot escape ads for Rupaul’s Drag Race if your online presence reveals any interest in LGBTQ+ issues stems from over-specialization.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“There is some empirical evidence for differential effects of algorithmic bias on demographic groups. […] Zafar et al. discuss “disparate mistreatment”, which arises when a classifier’s misclassification rates differ across social groups. An example (which stems from data bias) is how the COMPAS algorithm made more false positive errors with black defendants, labeling people who would not reoffend as being high risk while making more false negative errors with white defendants.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s one of those situations where there have been improvements but not enough and not on a wider scale. And it’s something companies like Google acknowledge and state they can’t solve outside of specific use cases that marginalised people draw their attention to. In that case, why should I trust any of the company’s search or wide AI advancements? Won’t they carry racial bias? I’m tired of shrugging my shoulders at the lack of energy to stop harming people who look like me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From an industry perspective, Jamar noted the defence of bigoted rhetoric in relation to \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LidiaInfanteM/status/1582352202781569024\">a tweet calling out the male bias of “SEO experts” in a SERP\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“[…] when they reply with some tone-deaf argument that women and minorities need to do the work to change Google’s results when you look up SEO experts, racism in the industry is alive and well.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nWe have too many people who think this way and drop some respectability politics into the mentions to defend it. […] Nothing we do can change the algorithm or the content it scrapes. That change needs to come from the SEOs making the lists and content that Google scrapes. The change needs to come from privileged white males, and this asinine need to make women and minorities do all the work to dismantle their oppression systems.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Trevor believed, to his knowledge, there had been no major shifts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Zenia concurred:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Has much changed? I don’t think so. I’m still seeing the same lists published of “best ppc experts” or “top SEOs” of 2022, and they’re all mostly white and mostly men. Conference headliners still skew very white and male. Leadership teams are still white and male.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And Melissa did too:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I don’t work exclusively in search but I am aware that many panels, conferences and events still centre white males as their most trusted contributors. More still needs to be done in the mainstream events to shine a spotlight on Black professionals in the industry - not because we’re Black but because we’re talented.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa said she was disappointed by major brands’ inaction against racial bias until the damage was done:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“It’s not something I noticed in my role at first, but I am aware of some AI presenting racial biases to black people. One thing I read a little while ago was that white content creators were able to monetise hateful terms and Google didn’t blacklist this until being prompted to.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nIt’s very disappointing when big companies brand themselves on being just and prohibiting hateful speech, but not taking systems to block this right away when they clearly have the resources to.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"diversity-in-2023what-does-it-mean\">Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 2020, I referenced a piece by Chanda Prescod-Weinstein called \u003Ca href=\"https://medium.com/space-anthropology/diversity-is-a-dangerous-set-up-8cee942e7f22\">‘Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up’\u003C/a> where she said trying to use science to analyse and fix racism was a dangerous proposition and that focusing on implicit bias at the expense of explicit bias and its impact could be harmful to the fight for equality. This year, she wrote a follow-up/reiterative piece entitled \u003Ca href=\"https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion\">‘About your diversity and inclusion requirement’\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I almost feel silly writing this piece because I have written some version of it so many times. I wrote Diversity is a Dangerous Set-Up and the Rules of the Diversity and Inclusion Racket. I also wrote long ago about the problems with the broader impacts criterion leading to students of color being treated like diversity props and minoritized scholars shouldn’t be forced to serve diversity.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI wrote, “The diversity racket is this: thinking that this is an intellectual exercise in being magnanimous, not a matter of survival.” I even wrote a whole chapter in my book about unwaged academic housework.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nSo I am tired and feel a bit silly but mostly furious because it is both ridiculous and deeply outrageous that it is necessary to write about this topic again, and surely this will not be the last time.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nBut also, as my grandmother Selma has said to me: I am shocked, but not surprised. Very little about the institutional relationship with “equity, diversity, and inclusion,” “diversity and inclusion,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and it’s newly extra woke iteration “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion” (JEDI, ha! so cute) surprises me. Because the institution’s goal is to survive, not to be better to us or for us. Our survival is not the institution’s goal. Our well-being is not the institution’s goal.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Trevor suggested diversity needed to be more specific and that more people from non-marginalised groups are speaking out:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Honestly it means too many things to too many people. It comes down to the organisation and what fits their environment. If they are recruiting and they find that their applicants all look like clones, there’s likely a problem. The difference post-2020 is that now everyone is noticing it and feels empowered to point it out as opposed to just those affected by the lack of diversity (whether that’s race, gender or disability).”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Zenia believes organisational shifts have only been superficial:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“I think it means that organizations are more aware of the optics - they know what diversity should look like, they know the language to make it seem like they support diversity, but that hasn’t resulted in meaningful change. Hiring practices are still the same, and these organizations have largely refused to re-invest in the communities that have been pillaged by decades of negligence and harmful capitalistic practices. The only difference is now there’s maybe a DEI meeting once a quarter.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>While Melissa wants to see a little less conversation and a little more action:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“It means almost the same but that people in leadership are being forced to actually pay attention to its meaning and the action. Back your chat, basically. I don’t want to hear that you’re listening and learning, I want to see that you’re providing support, resources and opportunities.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Clarissa believes diversity should be a responsibility at every level:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“In 2020, in the months of the Black Lives Matter protests, it was a time to bring to light the injustices but also showed support for black businesses, key figures and trailblazers all over the world. It presented the need for allyship and also recognised white privilege and how you can create a community with others by being open and willing to learn about the past, present and future.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI strongly believe that diversity needs to be in all areas, especially seniority. I say this because when their roles involve individuals, their wellbeing and progress, it’s empowering and welcomes other perspectives which I believe is key to progression. I believe with a lot of things it’s important to be intentional.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nThere tends to be an ongoing concern with performativity in organisations (I see it discussed with Black people I follow on social media) and how it is perceived by others. To me, this means not just speaking out about matters until certain events of the year (i.e. Black History Month) or until others are doing so. I can understand it can be (for a lack of a better word) scary, but it sets precedent for being unapologetically authentic.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nAlso, collaborating with others that are positively trying to make the digital marketing space by offering a soundboard for conversations to offer other perspectives is really important. As well as, cultivating relationships to be able to learn from one another.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>My efforts within D&#x26;I have certainly evolved over the last 3 years. The Black Lives Matter protests radicalised me more than I expected and I’ve been more active in terms of donations to grassroots organisations and being vocal in the space. I started a newsletter this year that focuses on diversity and inclusivity within recruitment and retention and learnt (and unlearnt) a lot about what D&#x26;I should mean.

We were told that eyes were opened, people stood with us as Black people, and that our voices would be amplified. But what has that all meant 3 years later?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Zenia praised her current employers for their subsequent actions but expressed her sadness at the lack of action from wider organisations:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The company that I’m at currently, Outside Inc., has put forth a ton of effort DEI (sic). There is still work to do, but there is investment in third-party resources to continuously grade the organization and hold it accountable. I love that about this company, but I wish it held true everywhere. I have friends of color in the industry - at agencies and in-house, and they’ve seen very little follow-up to those demonstrative pledges. Yeah sure, you turned the org’s social profile pic black, but what happened after that? It just feels so disheartening, and has caused a lot of my friends to divest from participation in DEI initiatives because they’re not seeing results or meaningful change. They’re doing the work elsewhere - via community organizations, mentorship, etc.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nI’ve also decided to take a break from participation in DEI work at work. Even being at an org that is doing the work well, I’m very tired. Working directly with mentees feels like more actionable and meaningful work for me right now. And to be frank, black folks have always done this work. After the disappointment of the last two years, it’s ok for us to step back and take a break. It’s time for allies to step in.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Jamar echoed this sadness more strongly:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The industry is okay with proximity to equity without any tangible equity being given. Conference lineups look relatively the same, and organizers continue asking women and minorities to nominate themselves for talks instead of doing work to identify new voices. In the months after George Floyd’s murder, I was hopeful the industry wanted to change. Now, I’m sure it doesn’t, and those of us who do will either need to work within a system that actively hates us or find solutions in other industries we might see a warmer welcome.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Melissa pointed out a need for better mental health support for Black employees:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“As far as the companies I have close contact with, I definitely see the conversations being continued but I’d like to see more support for Black people’s mental health in the industry. Our experiences are uniquely different and so the resources should be too.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s difficult to see what changes have been made when the pledges haven’t been reassessed a year or two later. \u003Ca href=\"https://moz.com/blog/black-lives-matter\">Moz wrote a statement in response to the BLM protests in June 2020,\u003C/a> followed by an update two days later responding to calls for evidence of their existing work. But no other updates since. On a personal level, I know my Twitter DMs were full of messages from non-Black colleagues asking for “sense checks” on statements, guilt, confirmation that I was “seen and heard”. It was very overwhelming and they continued even after I asked for them to stop. But they did eventually and after the dust settled, they rarely spoke to me about anything at all. And that’s how it has felt at an industry level since 2020. There are themed months on blogs, icon changes, and then 1st November arrives and it’s back to normal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"where-do-we-go-from-here\">Where do we go from here?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Having read Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s “\u003Ca href=\"https://chanda.substack.com/p/about-your-diversity-and-inclusion\">About your diversity and inclusion requirement\u003C/a>”, I empathise with her fatigue. It feels like a constant cycle of Black trauma bringing attention to systemic racism and people and enterprises becoming “aware”, making pledges, and watching the energy disappear over the space of a month. And Black people are always the one doing the work, making things known, and demanding change at every conceivable level whilst experiencing microaggressions, being passed up for promotions, getting fired, or not even finding work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within digital marketing, we’re acutely aware of racial biases in the search engine algorithms but also at an industry level in the lack of Black speakers at marketing conferences and Black marketers in agencies. And it’s not a case of nobody is doing anything but the actions are small and concentrated and can take a very long time to implement. They also need applied pressure—often from Black employees—to avoid them falling into the cracks. Amongst mounting deadlines and a mental health crisis amongst Black communities, it’s difficult to maintain that energy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the question becomes: where do we go from here, and who is “we”?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“We” should be everyone, regardless of race. That’s because white supremacy affects non-Black people too through non-racial discrimination. Therefore, institutional diversity and inclusion should be the work of everybody in an institution.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>A reminder of what I suggested 3 years ago:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Actively call for Black candidates for all open roles and hire them\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Offer multiple paths for progression\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Make intersectionality and inclusion prerequisites of working life\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Provide transparency in salaries at all levels\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>I still believe these things are necessary for Black marketers to feel more comfortable in their roles and places within the industry but I’d like to take it back further.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I recommend everybody reckon with their own biases and the discomfort that comes with it. Too much of this work is obscured by guilt, a need to apologise to Black people for “The Past”, and seeking redemption. It’s not up to Black people to absolve the guilt of others. This defers the grace and space we should all give ourselves to acknowledge and do better. Once we face ourselves, then we can start looking outward and call out the discrimination before us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that, it’s lifelong learning and action. That’s not the same as the listening and learning we heard incessantly in 2020 that amounted to nothing after the summer. There were plenty of anti-racism book lists published and, for some, those books were bought and left to collect dust on the shelf. The reading is a part of it but it’s not the full work. We also need to be mindful of what biases we perpetuate in our digital marketing. That includes optimising page titles that only say “Black man” or “Black woman” alongside negative stories— write their names . We also need to assess who we work with when it comes to link building. Many of the top news publications have histories of racism. Can we keep overlooking this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And finally, make Black people feel welcome. One of the primary results of microaggressions is to exclude, and often these exclusions are masked as obstacles or barriers of entry that “affects everyone, regardless of race”. By doing the prior work, we can make healthy, open, and safe environments for Black colleagues to be themselves and grow but also choose not to be involved as is their prerogative. As for those barriers of entry, they need to be checked too, and \u003Cstrong>before\u003C/strong> an incident occurs that causes unnecessary harm or frustration.\u003C/p>",{"headings":3113,"localImagePaths":3135,"remoteImagePaths":3136,"frontmatter":3137,"imagePaths":3140},[3114,3117,3120,3123,3126,3129,3132],{"depth":177,"slug":3115,"text":3116},"participants","Participants",{"depth":177,"slug":3118,"text":3119},"what-is-office-life-like-3-years-later","What is office life like, 3 years later?",{"depth":177,"slug":3121,"text":3122},"black-experiences-in-digital-marketing-in-2022","Black experiences in digital marketing in 2022",{"depth":177,"slug":3124,"text":3125},"racial-biases-in-searchtechnically-and-personally","Racial biases in search—technically and personally",{"depth":177,"slug":3127,"text":3128},"diversity-in-2023what-does-it-mean","Diversity in 2023—what does it mean?",{"depth":177,"slug":3130,"text":3131},"what-happened-to-the-industry-pledges-after-2020","What happened to the industry pledges after 2020?",{"depth":177,"slug":3133,"text":3134},"where-do-we-go-from-here","Where do we go from here?",[],[],{"title":3103,"description":3104,"published":38,"pubDate":3138,"tags":3139},"1 Oct 2023",[41,18,947,926],[],"being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023.md","beyond-tired-5",{"id":3142,"data":3144,"body":3149,"filePath":3150,"digest":3151,"rendered":3152,"legacyId":3162},{"title":3145,"description":3146,"tags":3147,"pubDate":3148},"Beyond tired: Part 5","Some thoughts on my mental health and therapy.",[41],["Date","2021-10-14T23:00:00.000Z"],"Hey, it's me&mdash;tired again.\n\nThis past week has been hell, mentally.

My (White) therapist was very receptive and agreed with my reasoning, which I didn't expect and welcomed.\n\nThe fact I felt so strongly about this movie that I brought it up as the focal point of a counselling session meant it had gone beyond so many other films I'd seen in my life. Not even my favourite movie of all time, Batman Returns, a film I've seen at least three times a year since I was 3, would come close in my soul.\n\nBut it hasn't been enough to dispel the spectre of White supremacy. After Chadwick Boseman's death, I felt myself searching in my mind for evidence that I wasn't performing at being sad. \"Black Panther did have that effect on me, right? I didn't just immerse myself in it recently?\" that's what I checked with myself. What the fuck is that? Of course I did. I watched the film a month after it came out, I cried in the cinema, and left feeling more emboldened than ever. I downloaded as many high-res wallpapers as I could and had them on rotation on my laptop. I used the unofficial Wakanda Forever emoji on Twitter extensively. I was crushed and infuriated when Black Panther and co. \"died\" in Infinity War&mdash;actually livid. I cried again when they reappeared in Endgame (I nearly cried writing that just now). And yet, I still had to confirm that I wasn't pretending.\n\nI put that down to the chokehold of White supremacy, making me second guess my identity as a mixed race Black man. You hear about mixed race people feeling like outsiders in the Black community. That has never been my experience so I could never relate. I've always felt welcomed, never questioned or treated like I didn't belong. So my issues have been internal and from outside the Black community; in places where White is right, namely the media. But Black Panther was one of the first times in years where I felt incredibly Black. I wasn't crying because the acting was magnificent or the special effects were cool. I cried because there was a Black AF superhero and Blackness was one of his superpowers as well as his peers. The Blackness of the movie comforted me and reminded me of what we had achieved, what we were achieving and what we *could* achieve.\n\nAnd that's why I spend my time doing what I can to abolish White supremacy in as many forms as I can. Nothing can be truly destroyed, I know that. So the energy of White supremacy is in exchange for mine and that energy can go into something positive for my own sake. And so I write about Black people in their sadness, happiness, triumph, joy, courage, strength, and vulnerability. The Internet is full of shit about Black people. As someone who works on the Internet for a living, I have a professional and moral duty to do something about it. And so I do.\n\nBlack Panther wasn't the first time I felt Black but it put my soul in the right place and enriched it.\n\nThank you, Chadwick.

It is also true.\n\nIt is in fact the image of a pipe. Seems like a pedantic statement to make but the concept there is crucial in the ideology behind what is and isn’t real. Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, “reality” TV shows. What you see isn’t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren’t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality. But we’re still told it’s real, and because people are now beginning to behave like this even without cameras there, it surely is. And there lies a paradox: it’s real but it’s not real at the same time.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is dangerous and echoes the map-territory relation, the relationship between the object and a representation of that object. Jean Baudrillard argued in his book Simulacra and Simulation that the “development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals”. Imagine a map drawn to the exact scale of the territory it is representing. The map would be so accurate that the territory itself would not precede the map and the territory would then have to fit the map and not the other way around. In other words, the image (or simulacrum) has taken precedent (Baudrillard, 1994:1). We allow the interpretations and perceptions of events and actions to become those events and actions and consciously or subconsciously spread these to other people where their meanings become lost in those misinterpretations and furthermore, those mistranslations. Deconstruction is needed, therefore, to bring back the initial foundations of what was real in the first place. Just because a stone hits someone on the foot and causes pain does not mean that all stones cause pain when dropped on all feet in the same way a politician is not entirely corrupt because of one’s perception of his or her action that that person deemed corrupt.\n\nThe simulacrum and real must therefore be separated before meaning of anything is lost. I was watching TV with my parents this evening and there was a storyline about euthanasia. The person in relation to the storyline was euthanised and everyone involved with the act were beside themselves with grief. My mum took this to heart and felt depressed after watching. My dad reassured her it wasn’t real and that it was just a programme. This isn’t an uncommon situation when watching an adaptation of an event. What we seem to forget is during the recording of that event, when the director said “cut”, the “dead” person would wake up and would be fine, the grief stricken mother would stop crying and smile and the third party would wipe away the fake vomit from his mouth, sniff and smile too. It was only a representation of euthanasia. This may seem obvious and needless to say, but in the moment of watching, this is all forgotten.\n\nThis proves the programme is doing what it set out to do, but the feelings conveyed are based on something that wasn’t real. Real feelings based on unreal events. Harmless enough if induced by a television programme but looking at it from a deconstructive point of view, this can be serious if it leads to real harmful events. That is a strong if, however, and I am not saying “unreal violence on TV will cause real violence in the real world”, but the possibility is always there, in the most extreme case. Video game violence is nothing more than code and numbers manipulated through the perception of violence from a human programmer who perceives violence in a way that he thinks the masses would relate to. Real (and complex) mathematics manipulated by a simulacrum of violence from a fallible human for another fallible human to feel real (and complex) emotions towards. Kind of like a real/unreal sandwich. It can leave a strange taste in the mouth.\n\nI have also perceived social networking to come under this kind of topic. If you take the words social and networking, you have both the real and virtual put together in one term; a common way of terminology, fusing binary signifiers together to create one sole meaning. The word social denotes people and the surroundings they live in. Networking represents the connection of objects or ideas and has been synonymous with technology since way before the dawn of the Technological Age. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to connect with other people and share ideas of their own and “interact”. But is this true interaction or the replacement of interaction? Am I really talking to my best friend or am I talking to an image of my best friend? It’s not unknown for people to create personas of themselves or of people they would like to be online (lord knows I’ve done it in the past, I’m ashamed to admit) and when you do eventually engage in forms of social interaction, these “personas” are shed and don’t pass through.\n\nThe whole ideology of social networking creates simulacra of society for the purposes of virtuality: to share information. You don’t expect your friends to speak in the same way they would online, sharing links to videos and funny lolcats photos. However in recent years there has been an emergence of what is called “leet speak” in spoken word, terms such as lol and lmao now used to denote varying degrees of laughter when laughter isn’t perceived to be warranted (I’ve used them, I am also ashamed to admit). Another case of the unreal becoming real and the line between the two becoming blurred, as Baudrillard had previously stated. Many say this is just the evolution of society and nothing to worry about, the convergence to a cosmopolitan-esque society through the use of sharing information, skills and a unique “language” to coincide with this way of living. Other see it as a dangerous way of life and perceive the loss of awareness of reality to be damaging to the way people live and see the world they live in.\n\nDavid Boyle’s Authenticity talks about this idea of the real and the unreal and asks what is real and what isn’t and conveys the idea that despite people wanting images of reality, they can still differentiate between the two and in fact, prefer the authentic from the replica. But you don’t have to listen to a word I’ve said. These aren’t even my original ideas and have probably been lost in interpretation and translation.

Reality and virtuality have coexisted for many years but since the dawn of postmodernism, the lines have blurred and virtuality has become reality and it is harder to decipher which is which in certain cases. Take for example, “reality” TV shows. What you see isn’t reality, or even an image of reality but an image of a perceived image of reality. People aren’t truly being themselves when they know the camera is there, they are being what they think other people think they should be and this persona is then projected to the masses in the form of another image. This idea is then glamourised and promoted through the use of advertising and word of mouth and sometimes loses any remnants of meaning and becomes nothing more than virtuality.

John Mueller still remains the MVP\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, thank you for your patience, hard work, and technical support. Same as last year. And the years before.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 2. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science have waxed and waned\n\nLast year, I said that AI, web performance, and graph science had \"enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined\" and while that's still true, they haven't all continued on an upward trajectory. I did an AI webinar last year and released a tool (which is effectively a OpenAI wrapper with some Python automation, built primarily for entry-level use) but my personal feelings have decreased as AI tech is used as an excuse to put people out of work and retain profits for capitalists. Now, I use generative AI sparingly and general NLP a bit more. Web performance still remains a passion although I still don't like how it's used as a beacon for ranking improvements when its focus should be on revenue and session quality attribution. And I haven't touched graph science for a long time. neo4j still isn't functional on M1 or M2 Mac chips and that's the only way I used it. I don't have the energy to find alternatives and learn a whole new UI.\n\n### 3. Python still rocks and I'm learning JavaScript (again)\n\nI'm building more tools in Python and it feels good. I'm also trying to learn JavaScript again because it matters for my work more than ever and I've been putting it off for years.\n\n### 4. I still love web performance\n\nI'm still doing lots of Core Web Vitals audits but now pushing back (in my head) on them for sites where site speed isn't a priority. If a site is small, CWV scores won't do anything for ranking and there are always bigger priorities.\n\nAnd I still say that synthetic data is important and we can build a more inclusive Web for everyone if we care enough and put in the work (sadly, I've not found a way to show this in a work capacity that DOESN'T involve a business case)\n\n## Misc\n\n### 5. Seriously, stop using (generative) AI for *everything*\n\nNLP, embeddings, vector search, clustering, fuzzy matching, all that kind of stuff? Good. It's under the AI umbrella and I think they are good use cases when done properly. But most of that isn't sexy so we're stuck with generative AI as the poster boy and a lot of it sucks. I've written that generative AI works well as a creative kickstarter but that's not how it's sold or how most people use it. Everyone complains about search results pages being filled with AI garbage written for the sake of SEO and The Verge are taking the lead on calling SEO out for a lot of the blame (with varying success, I won't go into it here because it bores and annoys me). We could just not use it so much and take care in how we use it. But experts couldn't pretend to know-it-all and sell us all snake oil and apparently, that's worse.\n\n#### 5a. I find generative AI really boring\n\nI've used generative AI a fair bit in the last few years but I apply some critical thinking to what I do because a lot of it isn't tested thoroughly and it's not scaled for mass use (tl;dr - it's not really at an adequate production level). The problem is, I see a lot of use cases that are promoted as \"something for everything\" but without any indication of methodology or testing. And everyone seems to be okay with it because they say \"ooh, interesting!\" And I honestly find this repetitive cycle boring. Generative AI may produce coherent sentences but they're soulless and even if you get a human to juj it up, why not just get the human to write it. Now, I've mentioned that [generative AI is good as a kickstarter](/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/) and I stand by that. But so many people are trying to hoodwink us, pretending that things have been checked when they haven't. We already have soulless, stale content written by humans—generative AI models only speed that process up and that's not innovation for me.\n\n### 6. I don't want to see your keyword/traffic graphs\n\nIn or out of context, all these Google Search Console and Ahrefs graphs mean nothing. And even with added information on how you scaled 100s of pages with templated text, you just look bad and that traffic will go the opposite way and you'll blame Google rather than yourself. If you start a website with no content and then start adding indexable content, your lines will eventually go up. It's not magic, it's not strategy, it's just how search engines work. Please stop.\n\n### 7. We all need to get our priorities straight\n\nSaving the best til last. I've had to learn that a lot of what we're asked to do or think we need to do isn't that important in the grander scheme of things. Site speed for most small sites isn't a priority compared to \"helpful content\" (unless the site is so slow that it's unusable and this often isn't the case, at least in my experience). Meta descriptions? Not a priority compared to literally anything. Bold keywords, keyword density, word count, \"LSI keywords\", keywords in headings, all things that should never be looked at or made priorities.\n\nAnd beyond the technicalities of our work, we also need to get it together from a moral and human perspective. Who are we working with and what do we stand for? I wrote about being [Black in digital marketing last year](/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/) and it was sad to see so many of those micro and macroaggressions still prevalent 3 years later. D&I is getting cut heavily in the tech industry and what is left isn't working for everyone. I get that these things are a work in progress but the **_progress_** isn't the thing to applaud and feel good about. And we shouldn't need data to justify actions—we should just be doing the actions, which goes beyond D&I.\n\nThe reality is that people think SEO is spammy crap. Whether that's true or not might not the thing to focus on. What these figure heads should be doing is demystifying a lot of our practices, not couch everything in vague language as to obscure what's really happening, and stop walling free information. There are plenty of things Google could do but profit and notoriety comes first. That doesn't mean we shouldn't keep fighting them on their crap practices but we should also keep our expectations in check. We won't find out what all the algorithms and factors are. Even these reports claiming they know what they are (looking at you, Backlinko) aren't that helpful.\n\nI once said that I liked SEO academically but disliked the industry. That still rings true today and there's still time to change that, for everyone.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to anyone I've spoken to personally in the last year or have shouted out publicly or in a work setting (you'll know who you are).

Seriously, stop using (generative) AI for \u003Cem>everything\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>NLP, embeddings, vector search, clustering, fuzzy matching, all that kind of stuff? Good. It’s under the AI umbrella and I think they are good use cases when done properly. But most of that isn’t sexy so we’re stuck with generative AI as the poster boy and a lot of it sucks. I’ve written that generative AI works well as a creative kickstarter but that’s not how it’s sold or how most people use it. Everyone complains about search results pages being filled with AI garbage written for the sake of SEO and The Verge are taking the lead on calling SEO out for a lot of the blame (with varying success, I won’t go into it here because it bores and annoys me). We could just not use it so much and take care in how we use it. But experts couldn’t pretend to know-it-all and sell us all snake oil and apparently, that’s worse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"5a-i-find-generative-ai-really-boring\">5a. I find generative AI really boring\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>I’ve used generative AI a fair bit in the last few years but I apply some critical thinking to what I do because a lot of it isn’t tested thoroughly and it’s not scaled for mass use (tl;dr - it’s not really at an adequate production level). The problem is, I see a lot of use cases that are promoted as “something for everything” but without any indication of methodology or testing. And everyone seems to be okay with it because they say “ooh, interesting!” And I honestly find this repetitive cycle boring. Generative AI may produce coherent sentences but they’re soulless and even if you get a human to juj it up, why not just get the human to write it. Now, I’ve mentioned that \u003Ca href=\"/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/\">generative AI is good as a kickstarter\u003C/a> and I stand by that. But so many people are trying to hoodwink us, pretending that things have been checked when they haven’t. We already have soulless, stale content written by humans—generative AI models only speed that process up and that’s not innovation for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"6-i-dont-want-to-see-your-keywordtraffic-graphs\">6. I don’t want to see your keyword/traffic graphs\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In or out of context, all these Google Search Console and Ahrefs graphs mean nothing. And even with added information on how you scaled 100s of pages with templated text, you just look bad and that traffic will go the opposite way and you’ll blame Google rather than yourself. If you start a website with no content and then start adding indexable content, your lines will eventually go up. It’s not magic, it’s not strategy, it’s just how search engines work. Please stop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"7-we-all-need-to-get-our-priorities-straight\">7. We all need to get our priorities straight\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Saving the best til last. I’ve had to learn that a lot of what we’re asked to do or think we need to do isn’t that important in the grander scheme of things. Site speed for most small sites isn’t a priority compared to “helpful content” (unless the site is so slow that it’s unusable and this often isn’t the case, at least in my experience). Meta descriptions? Not a priority compared to literally anything. Bold keywords, keyword density, word count, “LSI keywords”, keywords in headings, all things that should never be looked at or made priorities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And beyond the technicalities of our work, we also need to get it together from a moral and human perspective. Who are we working with and what do we stand for? I wrote about being \u003Ca href=\"/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/\">Black in digital marketing last year\u003C/a> and it was sad to see so many of those micro and macroaggressions still prevalent 3 years later. D&#x26;I is getting cut heavily in the tech industry and what is left isn’t working for everyone. I get that these things are a work in progress but the \u003Cstrong>\u003Cem>progress\u003C/em>\u003C/strong> isn’t the thing to applaud and feel good about. And we shouldn’t need data to justify actions—we should just be doing the actions, which goes beyond D&#x26;I.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The reality is that people think SEO is spammy crap. Whether that’s true or not might not the thing to focus on. What these figure heads should be doing is demystifying a lot of our practices, not couch everything in vague language as to obscure what’s really happening, and stop walling free information. There are plenty of things Google could do but profit and notoriety comes first. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep fighting them on their crap practices but we should also keep our expectations in check. We won’t find out what all the algorithms and factors are. Even these reports claiming they know what they are (looking at you, Backlinko) aren’t that helpful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I once said that I liked SEO academically but disliked the industry.

SEOs still love experts, even when they pass off second-hand information\n\nI still get called an \"expert\" in things. I'm still grateful for the recognition in my field. I still don't personally own that accolade. Many others still do despite primarily passing off second-hand information from experts outside [SEO](/jardim/tech/seo/) (I'm referring to [AI](/jardim/tech/ai/)).\n\nIf you want someone who knows their stuff in a different field, talk to someone in that field. Read papers, watch videos, attend conferences. Don't follow the sole advice of a \"SEO guru\" (eww, David!), and especially one that doesn't expand on the key areas of interest (such as biases and harms).\n\n### 2. John Mueller remains the MVP\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year. And the years before.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 3. My attraction to AI, web performance, and graph science continue to grow\n\nThese three disciplines have enhanced my experience of technical SEO far beyond what I could have imagined. I have used them all fairly regularly in my professional work over the last year and they've given me incredible insights and saved a lot of time. My next step is to standardise some of my approaches.\n\n### 4. Python still rocks and I'm back in the game\n\nI'd taken a bit of a break last year and the year before due to mental health but I'm back on the Python train and creating a whole load of techniques and scripts. You can see some of them on my Morsels page above.\n\n### 5. I love web performance\n\nCore Web Vitals was always a bit of a stumbling block for me. Because of how it was portrayed in the industry, it felt like a necessity and could only be done one way. But having done _so_ many audits in the last year, I've grown to understand what matters and what doesn't.\n\nAnd I will say this: synthetic data (aka lab data) and RUM data (aka field data) have their places in web performance and it's important to look at both when making changes because iPhone 14 users on 5G in the UK and US aren't the only people on the internet.\n\n## Misc\n\n### 6. Please stop using AI for bad things\n\nAsk yourself: will this cause harm to someone or a group of people in some way? Am I taking work away from someone who needs it? If the answer is yes, don't use AI for that thing. People should always come first in making these decicions and even if you do use AI for a task, people must be involved at every single stage.\n\nBecause most of AI use we see today involves some kind of model, underpinned by probabilities of the \"right\" output and put into the world with a healthy dose of confirmation bias (ie. well, I don't know how it got to that answer but this machine gave me something human-like so it must be okay).\n\nHallucinations can and do cause harm. Stop it. Get some (human) help.\n\n### 7. It's okay to not be okay, except all the times when it isn't\n\nSomething happened to me recently that shook me for a few days. It reminded me why I never used to open up to people or let myself be vulnerable and it comes down to how people throw slogans and platitudes in times of notable grief (e.g. when someone famous dies or there is a major world event) but when the dust settles, it's back to the same old lines&mdash;_don't do that, it makes me uncomfortable_.\n\nBut I won't go back in my shell. When I'm not okay, people who need to know will know. And those who don't because of how I've seen them act when people around the struggle won't get my grace.\n\n### 8. The industry still isn't great and AI is gonna make it worse\n\nEgos are still rampant in SEO but now that we have AI, I feel like it's going to get worse. [Prompt engineering](/posts/prompt-engineering/) is the latest craze that [I'd previously tweeted about as a close analogue to Facebook's video pivot controversy. We still don't know why these prompts work in the way they do but damned if someone with an expert complex is gonna be honest about that!\n\nLemme just say to be careful whose words you follow as gospel.

But what have I learnt? I wrote a list of 19 things I''ve picked up over that period.",[947],["Date","2020-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"I'm a little premature with this post but I feel like I tweet more about SEO than I write. At least in a personal capacity.\n\n[I wrote about my journey in digital marketing](/posts/eight/) when I got my job. Here is what I've learnt in my first year as a professional.\n\n## People\n### Women in SEO are the best\n\nWhen I started my work account on Twitter, I wanted to follow more people who weren't white men. The industry is already saturated and I wanted to hear from other voices. It's the best decision I've ever made.\n\nI've learnt more from the women in the industry than any other group. I'm grateful for their insights, the knowledge, their warmth and generosity. And I try to elevate and amplify as best I can without talking over anyone. Because, like I said, the industry is saturated with male voices and it needs to do better.\n\n### Experts aren't experts\n\nI followed the works of notable experts at the start (I won't name them but if you know, you know). Then the cracks in their veneers showed and I realised they were either shills, hypocrites, or both. And so I stop reading and listening.\n\nI've seen a lot of \"expert\" opinions with poor methodology or thin credibility. I'm not experienced in this field but I know bullshit when I see it and it shouldn't have a place in search.\n\n### There's still an inclusivity issue (but things are better)\n\nI used to look at agency sites for emails to send my CVs. And I looked at their team pages. I didn't see any people like me. It didn't bother me in the beginning. But over time, it disheartened me.\n\nAnd now I'm \"in\", I still see a lack of people of colour (especially black women and especially in SEO). Accessibility and active inclusivity (I try to avoid the word \"diversity\" now as it's lost all meaning) still need a lot of work. But it goes for any industry because that's how capitalism works.\n\nThere's still a sexism problem. It's not as bad as it used to be but there's still a way to go. So we need to do better for our peers who require assistance.\n\n### brightonSEO\n\nA friend of mine went to [brightonSEO](https://brightonseo.com/) one year and I was super jealous. Then I got to go last year and it was awesome. And I'm going again this year, with more experience under my belt.\n\nI loved being there and being able to immerse myself in an industry conference. I anticipate this year's being just as good if not better.\n\n## Keywords\n### It's about topics, not individual keywords\n\nI spent a lot of time focusing on keywords - number of keywords, where they were used and how. Then I read about topic relevancy and entities and everything changed.\n\nSuddenly it was about clusters of rich, meaningful content interlinked with other pages. It made perfect sense to me. A web within the Web. Since then, I make sure to cover the right topics in a way that helps the reader and, in turn, they help search engines. \n\n### Ranking for a targeted keyword was my highlight\n\nI've been [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) for over a decade and most of the time, I don't write with a keyword in mind. Last year, I wrote an article for work and it now ranks for industry-related keywords. Page session times are always great and the page has lead to conversions. It feels good to know I did that (even if the original had to be cut down for reasons)\n\n## Technical\n### Technical SEO is my strong suit\n\nI used to mention the fact I was analytical on my CV. Then I stopped because nobody really cared. But it was still true, even if the work I pursued was more about writing than anything technical. My current job started in copywriting but my SEO knowledge was what got it for me and eventually I became an SEO executive. I still write and optimise content but I've honed my technical skills more than anything else over the last few months and that's where my head and heart lie. Which leads me onto the next heading.\n\n### Python is amazing\n\nI know HTML isn't a programming language but it got me into coding and that lead me to my first language: [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). I studied Computer Science at Nottingham Trent for 6 months until I realised it wasn't for me. And now I hate C++.\n\nLater on, I tried JavaScript and nearly made headway but then I lost motivation. Finally, I found Python and it clicked. It was easy enough to learn and understand but robust enough to create incredible scripts capable of small-to-large scale tasks. I started learning in October and I've already created a Google scraper for content ideas and last week, I wrote an article for PPC Hero about [Python's potential in paid search](https://www.ppchero.com/how-learning-python-can-improve-your-ppc-campaigns/).\n\nI've still got a long way to go but this is the best part of my career so far.\n\n### JavaScript is overused\n\nThis has nothing to do with my aborted attempt at learning JavaScript and I'm not saying it's useless or rubbish or overrated. JavaScript is amazing... it's just that it causes a lot of bloat on the Web. Which isn't the fault of the language, rather the people programming it (or the people in charge of the people programming it).\n\nDoes a site need so many scripts and frameworks? Is jQuery essential? Is there an alternative to Gatsby? You could save yourself money and page load speed. By the way, I'm not shitting on devs because they get enough of that as it is. I just think JS isn't the solution to everything on the Web.\n\n### APIs are amazing\n\nIs there anything APIs can't do? Actually, don't answer that.\n\nAn API fuels my scraper. Every time I use a service, I ask myself \"does this have an API\" and it usually does and I make a note of it for future use. [Pokémon](https://pokeapi.co/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) are two examples. Even better if the APIs are free to access. They're a great way to practise in your language of choice.\n\n## Content and Links\n### Use headings more\n\nMy scraper extracts headings from the links on Page 1 of a given SERP (amongst other HTML elements). Having used it for a couple of months for work and recreation, it made me realise just how poorly headings were used. Either they were used as a decorative element or not at all. Both are bad.\n\nHeadings split up blocks of texts and describe what each section is about. They also help people who use screen readers as they can skim and skip to content that means the most to them. And they're not there for keyword stuffing (because headings don't help with ranking).\n\n### The inverted pyramid model is a good idea\n\n[The inverted pyramid model](https://study.com/learn/lesson/inverted-pyramid-style-journalism.html) is not ideal in every situation but sometimes you just want to know what a long read is about. And if it interests you enough, you'll read more. I've heard naysayers claim TL;DR's kill dwell time but I disagree. Considering Google uses the first page of SERPs to add their own version of TL;DRs (better known as [featured snippets](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/onpage-optimisation/what-are-featured-snippets/)), if they dodge those and actually click your link, they're ready to read. And the inverted pyramid model can help with outlining content and then explaining it all in more detail.\n\n### There's a lot of the same content out there\n\nToday, I found an article called [Copycat Content: SEO Tools Got Us Here, Humans Will Get Us Out](https://www.animalz.co/blog/copycat-content/) and the first paragraph echoes my sentiments for a lot of web content:\n\n> There’s a copycat crisis in content marketing. Explore the search results for virtually any lucrative keyword, and you’ll find a bunch of articles with lookalike titles, headers and examples. Increasingly, “SEO content” has become a synonym for meandering “ultimate guides” and formulaic “7 ways” listicles.\n\nWhen analysing the SERPs for intent, we're told to follow certain patterns. But what does that say to the user and the professional? That the \"best\" content needs to include a number, a power word, a noun, and your keyword? Does everything need to follow the leader to join the leader on Page 1? Is it worth the risk to not do that? Of course, there's more to ranking than a good meta title but a lot of advice out there suggests we do these kinds of things and there's a lot of the same advice, competing to be the loudest and highest ranked.\n\n### Internal linking is important\n\nI never took this into consideration back in the day (I didn't know any better). But internal linking is so important. It passes link juice, helps with navigation, and it can increase page session time (and page sessions). If you're writing good content that links to more good content, you're going to keep a user on your site. And if it's an e-commerce site, that means more money spent.\n\n### So is a good architecture\n\nSomething else I didn't pay enough attention to in the past. I have a blog that has over 1400 posts. [Crawl depth](https://www.oncrawl.com/oncrawl-seo-thoughts/page-depth-how-it-affects-your-seo-performance/) is an issue (I'm working on it, okay?!) but has helped me think about my site architecture. A better site structure means pages get crawled quicker and more often.\n\n## Google\n### Google is not a meritocracy\n\n[I wrote a piece on this](https://adzooma.com/blog/google-is-not-a-meritocracy/)] so I won't repeat it. But for all the good things Google does, there are some grey areas and red flags.\n\n### But John Mueller is awesome\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit.\n\n## Misc\n### I love the Web even more\n\nI've loved the Web since those nights in Stripling Elementary School's library in Atlanta in 2000. The Web was full of portals and I loved walking through them. It was like I was destined to work in search. And I love doing it. I have issues with how it's used and the people who try to govern it, but the Web itself is a wonderful system.\n\n### I love not doing SEO\n\nSeems like a strange way to finish a review on my first year as an SEO but working in it 40+ hours a week has made me appreciate doing the opposite of all those \"best practices\". Writing without E-A-T in mind, not fine-tuning titles and descriptions, not caring about word count (because [it's not a ranking factor FOR THE LOVE OF GOD](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/revisiting-word-count/316335/)).\n\nIf I want to write about something, I'll write about it. There's no need for everything on the internet to be coiffured \"for Google\". My favourite piece of content on the internet probably don't rank for anything or get heaps of traffic. But they mean something to me. And other examples will mean things to others. Google is not my parent and I won't let the company tell me what to do with my online expressions. ALRIGHT?!\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to [Natalie Arney](https://nataliearney.com/), [Ruth Everett](https://twitter.com/rvtheverett), [Ronke Lawal](https://www.ronkelawal.com/), Tony Randall, [Tom Mortimer](https://twitter.com/tomaszmortimer), Jess Kirkbride, Danielle Strouther, Amber Dawson, [Areej AbuAli](https://www.areejabuali.com/), Dan Rice, [Tatiana Mac](https://www.tatianamac.com/), [Maret Reutelingsperger](https://twitter.com/itsmaret), and other people I'll invariably add later on.

If you don't know, Veo 3 is a new generative AI model by Google that produces audiovisual content. The demo in question showed a improv comedian making a joke about going to a zoo and they only had one dog which was a shih tzu, followed by audience laughter. Although I loathe and despite AI-generative videos for many reasons, it looked objectively better than anything I'd seen before. Go them I guess?\n\nThe comments were a mixed bag—as you'd expect. People were astounded by the quality, frightened by the quality, angry at yet another model and the implications of it, and not getting the joke. I'm not here to explain the joke (mainly because I don't care) but to discuss the _meta_-criticism of these reactions.\n\n## Gotta have faith\n\n[One quote post](https://bsky.app/profile/minimaxir.bsky.social/post/3lpnkccs2cc2d) that I saw came from someone whose work I respect and use quite a lot when I do use large language models. But his response reminded me of a sense of frustration from AI/ML practitioners that reduces commentary down to good faith vs. bad faith. Basically, he said that commenters assumed the demo was posted as \"AI slop\" rather than a neutral demonstration of the technology and that appears to be the common reaction.\n\nThis is a fair assessment. But the question is why are people so virulent and cold towards AI demos? Is it because of [the environmental impacts](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about) which [some have downplayed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54271-x) or have claimed are misinterpreted? Or the moral implications given how [the technology uses copyrighted material for training without permission](https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem), not to mention [inherent human biases and forms of discrimination](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07856-5)? There's a lot to criticise and big tech companies keep getting funded, keep polluting the planet to gain power and fuel the models, and turn a blind eye to the growing spread of mis/disinformation thanks to this tech. [And where's the accountability from Big Tech](https://europeandemocracyhub.epd.eu/big-tech-is-avoiding-responsibility/)?\n\n## Maybe AI is cancelling culture...\n\nSo many people are being impacted by AI technology so I think the negative feedback is justified. You can blame moral panic or \"\"\"cancel culture\"\"\" as a broad reason but that's too easy and might not even be true. Nobody _has_ to give a lengthy, detailed explanation as to why they're mad at this stuff. If the companies are acting in bad faith so often, why shouldn't we act in kind?\n\nAnd let's be real here: do we need Veo 3? Who's really going to be using it and for what purposes? Did we not just see the film industry grind to a halt due to strikes related to misuse of AI tech at the expense of workers? Are people not getting laid off and replaced for this tech? Maybe that default good faith is allowing nefarious entities to keep doing nefarious things. Instead, we should look at track records, expect nothing _or_ bad at best, and be stringent on what should and shouldn't be done. I think that's called regulation but I could be wrong. There's so little of it in this space, I forget.\n\n## Must be something in the air\n\nThe Veo 3 demo of the improv comedian was meant to showcase its capabilities. It did that. It looked better than a lot of crap we've seen. But focusing on the critiques rather than why people are critiquing it in the way that they are isn't helpful either.\n\nAnd this isn't to focus on one post and embellish it beyond its confines. I referenced a Nature article saying \"well actually humans pollute more than AI and AI could actually help reduce it\" which looks remarkable given the issues in Memphis where xAI has used a number of portable methane gas turbines without air permits to help power its supercomputer ([source](https://www.selc.org/news/resistance-against-elon-musks-xai-facility-in-south-memphis-gets-stronger/)). This has negatively impacted air quality in the area. Of course, this is also being downplayed but that's where we're at. Companies doing things they shouldn't, impacting people, people complaining, and then being told to stop complaining and that they're wrong. Aren't we tired of this? Many of us don't have the energy to go down the middle with this and \"hear them out\".\n\nUsually these kinds of morally panicked responses come from conservatives—and they still do—but those same people are the ones funding the tech and using it for political gain so perhaps we need to look away from generalisation and pinpoint the issues and meet people where they are.

The year 2000 to be exact.\n\n## Web 1.0\n\nI was living in Atlanta at the time as my dad had got a teaching job out there. While we only lasted 6 months out there, it was the start of my obsession with the Web. My mum worked at my school library a few times a week and every Wednesday, I'd stay after school for a couple of hours and spend my time in the library. Amongst the shelves of books were a few rows of computers and I'd basically fall down Web-bit holes, exploring everything the Internet had to offer. When we moved back to the UK, I got myself a Yahoo! email address and consolidated my preferences for their search engine over Google (even Ask Jeeves took precedence!). I also discovered that you could make your own website, thrusting me into the world of web development.\n\nIt was all about Tripod and Homestead for Web hosting, Geocities, FrontPage Express (the free version of Microsoft Frontpage), and lots of HTML. I'd use my dad's work laptop to code my site after spending 20 minutes plucking up the courage to ask. I never finished a site but it was so fun that I didn't care.\n\nEventually, I matured and moved onto Dreamweaver, more sustainable Web hosting, and then a myriad of different frameworks and environments. It was mostly HTML and, now, CSS. Building stuff from scratch. There was no \"responsiveness\" back then. I avoided Flash like the plague but thought \"[slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing_(interface_design))\" was the most amazing thing that I just couldn't pull off. And absolutely no JavaScript, yuck!\n\n## My start as an Astro-naut\n\nFast forward to 2021 and by then, I was on the tenth iteration of my personal site and I'd started working for my current employer as an SEO Executive. I was using Grav at the time and enjoying it, although I didn't get on with its templating language, Twig (with hindsight, I get it now). I'd even tried Jekyll for a bit when I got obsessed with the idea of linkblogs and [Monica Dinculescu's website](https://meowni.ca/) (which remains a stylistic inspiration for this one).\n\nThen I found Astro, this new framework that promised \u003Cq cite=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/\">faster websites with less client-side Javascript\u003C/q>. I'd just started getting into Web performance so this piqued my interest. I was comfortable enough Terminal and running builds to get behind how Astro worked. So I took the plunge.\n\nLemme tell ya: those first few months were \u003Cspan style=\"color:#fc1420;\">**_hell_**\u003C/span>.\n\nI spent hours and hours trying to get things working. The truth was, while there was less client-side JavaScript&mdash;with it being a static site generator&mdash;there was MORE JavaScript in the backend for me. I'd been used to hard-coding everything but Astro gave me the opportunity to create stuff dynamically. Go to my homepage and you'll see a little greeting in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. That's static now but in the pre-build code, it's JavaScript. At least that was simple.\n\n## Persistence paid off... until it didn't... and then it did again\n\nAll those nights troubleshooting until 3am paid off in the end. I'd joined the Discord, became engaged, asked for help, and got what I needed to that point. But with more updates came new features. [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) were introduced with Astro 2.0. These allowed for better management of content in an Astro project if you had, say, a blog or newsletter, or wanted to consolidate authors. The problem was that I'd set everything up without this and the thought of refactoring everything gave me a headache, so I abstained for a while.\n\nThe idea of lagging behind didn't sit well with me though and I rolled up my proverbial sleeves and gave it a go. Thanks to the documentation and not caring much about the URL changes (post > posts, oh no what would Google do???), I pulled through and have since built the collections out with more sections. Easy peasy...\n\n...no really. That was it. My woes were over (well, apart from reducing some of the bloat from my node modules folder which briefly broke everything but it all got fixed)\n\nI did have one more dragon to slay though: JavaScript.\n\n## How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love JavaScript\n\nWorking in technical SEO means exposure to JavaScript, either directly through JavaScript SEO or realising that web devs use it way too much and... let me not digress. I'd tried learning multiple times in the past and couldn't get my head around it all. It all felt too much like C++ which I'd tried and failed with during the computer science degree I dropped out of in 2008.\n\nBut if you've got this far, you'll know I don't let something get me down for too long when it comes to learning. I started up my web development course again on Udemy and went through everything from the beginning. I was well versed in Python already so most of the basics were the same but I didn't want to skip over anything. Eventually, I got the hang of the easy stuff and got to grips with event handlers (love those things), figured out what maps did after using them without prior knowledge. Everything was clicking and I had Astro to thank for setting me on the path.\n\n## Would I recommend Astro?\n\nHell yeah I would. There are a ton of Web frameworks out there (I think it should be called JAMStack**ed** to be honest) and they all come with their own pros and cons but Astro caught my eye ~~first~~ second for a few reasons:\n\n* The community is super helpful and friendly\n* You can use as little or as much JavaScript as you want but HTML and CSS are the foundations: it's all about progressive enhancement\n* All the major frameworks integrate with Astro really well, and you can extend it with a variety of CMS's\n* It's constantly evolving but in a way that enriches rather than alienates\n* The syntax will be familiar to people who have used other frameworks before and relatively easy to pick up if you haven't\n* They really care about web performance, so sites are super fast out of the box (and I'm obliged to say this is good for SEO BUT [only as a small factor as I've written about before](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf/))\n* They helped me overcome my fear of JavaScript and use it strategically to embellish what I already had, rather than replace\n\nIf you want to join in and build a better Web, [head to the Astro website and get started](https://astro.build/).","src/content/posts/how-astro-changed-my-web-life.md","baf50c6eef3c39b7",{"html":4083,"metadata":4084},"\u003Cp>In 2021, I embarked on a journey that would change how I saw web development and how I interacted with the Web from a technical perspective and a creative one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But before I go into that, let me take you back to the early 00s.

It was mostly HTML and, now, CSS. Building stuff from scratch. There was no “responsiveness” back then. I avoided Flash like the plague but thought “\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing_(interface_design)\">slicing\u003C/a>” was the most amazing thing that I just couldn’t pull off. And absolutely no JavaScript, yuck!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"my-start-as-an-astro-naut\">My start as an Astro-naut\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Fast forward to 2021 and by then, I was on the tenth iteration of my personal site and I’d started working for my current employer as an SEO Executive. I was using Grav at the time and enjoying it, although I didn’t get on with its templating language, Twig (with hindsight, I get it now). I’d even tried Jekyll for a bit when I got obsessed with the idea of linkblogs and \u003Ca href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu’s website\u003C/a> (which remains a stylistic inspiration for this one).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then I found Astro, this new framework that promised \u003Cq cite=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/\">faster websites with less client-side Javascript\u003C/q>. I’d just started getting into Web performance so this piqued my interest. I was comfortable enough Terminal and running builds to get behind how Astro worked. So I took the plunge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lemme tell ya: those first few months were \u003Cspan style=\"color:#fc1420;\">\u003Cstrong>\u003Cem>hell\u003C/em>\u003C/strong>\u003C/span>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I spent hours and hours trying to get things working. The truth was, while there was less client-side JavaScript—with it being a static site generator—there was MORE JavaScript in the backend for me. I’d been used to hard-coding everything but Astro gave me the opportunity to create stuff dynamically. Go to my homepage and you’ll see a little greeting in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. That’s static now but in the pre-build code, it’s JavaScript. At least that was simple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"persistence-paid-off-until-it-didnt-and-then-it-did-again\">Persistence paid off… until it didn’t… and then it did again\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>All those nights troubleshooting until 3am paid off in the end. I’d joined the Discord, became engaged, asked for help, and got what I needed to that point. But with more updates came new features. \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/\">Content Collections\u003C/a> were introduced with Astro 2.0. These allowed for better management of content in an Astro project if you had, say, a blog or newsletter, or wanted to consolidate authors. The problem was that I’d set everything up without this and the thought of refactoring everything gave me a headache, so I abstained for a while.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The idea of lagging behind didn’t sit well with me though and I rolled up my proverbial sleeves and gave it a go. Thanks to the documentation and not caring much about the URL changes (post > posts, oh no what would Google do???), I pulled through and have since built the collections out with more sections. Easy peasy…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>…no really. That was it. My woes were over (well, apart from reducing some of the bloat from my node modules folder which briefly broke everything but it all got fixed)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I did have one more dragon to slay though: JavaScript.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-javascript\">How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love JavaScript\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Working in technical SEO means exposure to JavaScript, either directly through JavaScript SEO or realising that web devs use it way too much and… let me not digress. I’d tried learning multiple times in the past and couldn’t get my head around it all. It all felt too much like C++ which I’d tried and failed with during the computer science degree I dropped out of in 2008.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But if you’ve got this far, you’ll know I don’t let something get me down for too long when it comes to learning. I started up my web development course again on Udemy and went through everything from the beginning. I was well versed in Python already so most of the basics were the same but I didn’t want to skip over anything. Eventually, I got the hang of the easy stuff and got to grips with event handlers (love those things), figured out what maps did after using them without prior knowledge. Everything was clicking and I had Astro to thank for setting me on the path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"would-i-recommend-astro\">Would I recommend Astro?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Hell yeah I would. There are a ton of Web frameworks out there (I think it should be called JAMStack\u003Cstrong>ed\u003C/strong> to be honest) and they all come with their own pros and cons but Astro caught my eye \u003Cdel>first\u003C/del> second for a few reasons:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>The community is super helpful and friendly\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can use as little or as much JavaScript as you want but HTML and CSS are the foundations: it’s all about progressive enhancement\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>All the major frameworks integrate with Astro really well, and you can extend it with a variety of CMS’s\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>It’s constantly evolving but in a way that enriches rather than alienates\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The syntax will be familiar to people who have used other frameworks before and relatively easy to pick up if you haven’t\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They really care about web performance, so sites are super fast out of the box (and I’m obliged to say this is good for SEO BUT \u003Ca href=\"https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf/\">only as a small factor as I’ve written about before\u003C/a>)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They helped me overcome my fear of JavaScript and use it strategically to embellish what I already had, rather than replace\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>If you want to join in and build a better Web, \u003Ca href=\"https://astro.build/\">head to the Astro website and get started\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>",{"headings":4085,"localImagePaths":4101,"remoteImagePaths":4102,"frontmatter":4103,"imagePaths":4106},[4086,4089,4092,4095,4098],{"depth":177,"slug":4087,"text":4088},"web-10","Web 1.0",{"depth":177,"slug":4090,"text":4091},"my-start-as-an-astro-naut","My start as an Astro-naut",{"depth":177,"slug":4093,"text":4094},"persistence-paid-off-until-it-didnt-and-then-it-did-again","Persistence paid off… until it didn’t… and then it did again",{"depth":177,"slug":4096,"text":4097},"how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-javascript","How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love JavaScript",{"depth":177,"slug":4099,"text":4100},"would-i-recommend-astro","Would I recommend Astro?",[],[],{"title":4074,"description":4075,"published":38,"pubDate":4104,"tags":4105},"18 May 2024",[4077,422],[],"how-astro-changed-my-web-life.md","how-i-display-my-last-fm-top-1000-artists",{"id":4108,"data":4110,"body":4115,"filePath":4116,"digest":4117,"rendered":4118,"legacyId":4134},{"title":4111,"description":4112,"published":38,"tags":4113,"pubDate":4114},"How I display my Last.fm top 1000 artists","A lengthy post on how I create my list of Last.fm top 1000 artists",[168,1107],["Date","2023-04-27T23:00:00.000Z"],"\u003Cem>Note: I have since updated the below code as of 4th May 2023.\u003C/em>\n\nI decided to create a page to [display my Last.fm top 1000 artists](/lastfm-top-1000/). Here's how I did it.\n\n## 1. Get the data\n\nTo get this data, you need the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) and an account. With my credentials, I wrote a script that scraped the data and created a JSON file out of it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport datetime\n\npayload = {\n  'api_key': API_KEY,\n  'format': 'json',\n  'limit': 1000,\n}\n\nr = requests.get('https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.gettopartists&user=USERNAME', params=payload)\n\nres = r.json()\n\nfor key in range(0,len(res['topartists']['artist'])):\n    \n    # Change playCount from str to int\n    res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'] = int(res['topartists']['artist'][key]['playcount'])\n\n    res['last updated'] = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%d %B %Y')\n\nwith open('../data/lastfm.json', \"w+\") as f:\n    json.dump(res, f, indent=4)\n```\n\nThis created a \u003Ccode>lastfm.json\u003C/code> file. I also included a key for the date when I update the file so I can display that on the page. Now there's time to use the Fetch API.\n\n## 2. Fetch the data\n\nI use the Fetch API for my wiki pages to pull data from my other WordPress blogs via the REST API. In this case, I'm pulling from a local JSON file so I start by importing the file:\n\n```javascript\nimport lastfm from '../data/lastfm.json';\n```\n\nThen I use .map() to map the rank, artist, and playcount to a table.\n\n```html\n\u003Cp>Last updated: {lastfm['last updated']}\u003C/p>\n  \u003Ctable>\n    \u003Cthead>\n      \u003Ctr>\n        \u003Cth>Pos.\u003C/th>\n        \u003Cth>Artist\u003C/th>\n        \u003Cth>Playcount\u003C/th>\n      \u003C/tr>\n    \u003C/thead>\n  {lastfm.topartists.artist.map((item) => (\n    \u003Ctr>\n      \u003Ctd>{item['@attr'].rank}\u003C/td>\n      \u003Ctd>\u003Ca href={item.url}>{item.name}\u003C/a>\u003C/td>\n      \u003Ctd>{item.playcount.toLocaleString()}\u003C/td>\n    \u003C/tr>\n  ))}\n  \u003C/table>\n```\n\nA couple of things to note: \u003Ccode>lastfm.topartists.artist.map\u003C/code> gets all the artist data and \u003Ccode>item.playcount.toLocaleString()\u003C/code> converts the playcount and adds a thousands comma seperator.\n\nAnd that's it.

An old friend gave me a cracked copy of Logic Pro 8 which I used before I upgraded to [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) and rode that train for the next 10 years. Most of my discography was made on Logic and it worked super well for me. I'd heard of [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) but didn't want to move away from what I knew because it worked.\n\nBut in 2020, I felt that I needed to try something different and my aversion to Ableton was having to learn a new piece of technology to make music. I'd been in a creative rut for 3 years between 2015–2018 and I worried that the frustration of a new DAW (digital audio workstation) made me anxious. But what better time to get to grips with something than during a global pandemic?\n\nSo, with the free copy of Ableton Live Lite 10 that came with my [Novation Launchkey Mini MKII](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Novation-Launchkey-Mini-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B00VVNOMGI?&linkCode=ll1&tag=liofast-21&linkId=63b05a1bb4d1b7a98ffe8140f37c311c&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (affiliate link), I took the plunge and while it took a few weeks to get used to, I got the hang of it. And in that year, I made one of my best albums ever called [Justice&Peace](https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/justice-peace). My favourite part of Ableton was the sample manipulation. Time and pitch stretching were so much better compared to Logic as the sample quality never felt like it was deteriorating if I made it super slow or drop the pitch right down. And so many features to try out.\n\n4 years later and I've since upgraded to Ableton Lite Intro and I'm part of the beta program (12 is coming soon, folks!) and those features? I've barely added any new ones to my repertoire since I started in 2020. I've watched videos by some amazing musicians who use Ableton and thought their dexterity for the software was sublime. But you know what? I'm actually okay with my simple setup.\n\nI have a lot of gear that I hardly use, mainly because I don't have a fixed setup—a lot of my music is made in or on my bed still. Sometimes, I'll take it to my work desk but it's usually just my laptop or I include my Launchkey Mini into the mix (no pun intended). But I have a template that loads up every time I open Ableton:\n\n* 4 tracks of audio\n* 3 tracks for the kick, snare, and hi-hat\n* 1 track for vocal samples (woos and yeahs, that kinda thing)\n* My mastering chain with a limiter and basic EQing\n\nI have a ton of drum samples, both downloaded and via [Splice](https://splice.com/). I use as many different ones as I can and sample sample sample. My workflow involves churning beat drafts out and coming back to them later to mold them into proper beats. Having a basic foundation caters to that. I know if I had lots going on from the start, I'd be overwhelmed and wouldn't get things done. But having the option to build on top of what I have *if I want to* is essential.\n\nSo if you've reached this far and have felt like Ableton is overwhelming or you're worried that you're not doing enough with what you have, I say: you're doing just fine. Make a template like mine with enough of what you need to get started and finish with and have fun. Add components if you want. Or don't.

I had less time to make music, a long distance relationship to maintain and found myself in a motivational rut. I tried forcing through it and that made it worse.

As I learn by doing, I've decided to show off arguably my greatest creation to do date. I wasn't sure whether to do it as it's very niche to me but I've taken a step out of my comfort zone.\n\n[GitHub link to RALTS repository](https://github.com/starchildluke/ralts)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n1.

[Summary](#summary)\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ralts\"> What is RALTS?\u003C/h2>\n\nRALTS stands for (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) and it's a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But what it also does is use NLP classification to analyse that text based on labels pulled from the extracted topics. Confused? I'll explain those all in more detail later.\n\nThere is also a secondary function that has nothing to do with suggesting tags but I'll explain it here. I have also set up functionality that pulls all my tags from my blogs and randomly joins them together in a Google search query for content ideas. They are inversely weighted so the least used tags appear more frequently in the randomised search queries.\n\nExamples:\n\n* https://google.com/search?q=vhs+black+cinema\n* https://google.com/search?q=cuba+snow\n* https://google.com/search?q=nike+poetry\n* https://google.com/search?q=night+keith+haring\n* https://google.com/search?q=australia+dogs\n\nIn terms of the name, I chose RALTS because all the Sesame Street references were taken and I'm a Pokémon fan. It's a backronym but it works for me.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why_did_you_make_this\">Why did I make it?\u003C/h2>\n\ntl;dr: it aids my blogging process.\n\nI love anything to do with taxonomies, ontologies, and classification. I'm a tagger and a labeler. There are limits to what and how I label in a social and metaphysical sense but for my blogs, I love the process. It helps my information retrieval and it ties so well into SEO (which is my profession in case you missed it).\n\nFundamentally, I wanted a script to tell me what tags to use for my blogs if I couldn't think of any or had retrospectively missed anything. By extracting entities and topics, I can cross reference it with existing tags or spot any new ones that make sense or keep cropping up.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"notes_on_my_coding\">Notes on my coding\u003C/h2>\n\nBefore I dive into the code, I want to make something clear: I've only been coding in Python for just under 2.5 years. I've done all of this in my own time with no formal training and following a Udemy course I still haven't finished. You'll likely see some inefficient or unpythonic code. If you do, feel free to shout up as that will help me improve. But please: only constructive feedback. There are way too many videos online calling people out for \"stupid code\" and I find it demeaning and gatekeep-y (technical term).\n\nI also want to give credit to Joe Davison whose data plot code I used from his zero shot demo. He wrote a great piece on [zero shot learning](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) which you should read if you're interested.\n\n[There's also a live zero shot classification demo you can try that shows the code I copied in action](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joeddav/zero-shot-demo).\n\nIf I've taken anything that belongs to anyone whom I've forgotten to credit or if you'd prefer I remove it, please let me know and accept my sincerest apologies.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"some_definitions\">Some definitions\u003C/h2>\n\nSo, about that original explanation. Let's look at some definitions:\n\n* Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.\n\n* Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has \"an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction\".\n\n* Categories - The term \"categories\" is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising\n\n* Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically. The aim of the script is to do this with the help of the extracted topics and a machine learning language model.\n\n* Labels - Forms of annotation that classify what a text is about. They're basically like tags.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tech_requirements\">Tech requirements\u003C/h2>\n\nThese are the following Python packages used in the script:\n\n```\nstreamlit>=1.0.0\npandas>=1.2.3\ntransformers>=4.12.3\nrequests>=2.25.1\nbs4>=0.0.1\nplotly>=5.4.0\nnumpy>=1.18.0\ntextrazor==1.4.0\ntensorflow>=2.7.0\n```\n\n[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for the language model, requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for web scraping, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data viz, [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) for the entities and such, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the language model.\n\nRegarding TensorFlow, the language model I'm using is called [DistilBart-MNLI](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9) and instructions can be found on the Hugging Face link about how to download, fine-tune, deploy, and use in Transformers via Python.\n\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the_code\">The code\u003C/h2>\n\nThe code is split into different parts:\n\n### 1. TextRazor API key and client details\n\n```python\n# TextRazor details\ntextrazor.api_key = API_KEY\n\nclient = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors=[\"entities\", \"topics\"])\nclient.set_classifiers([\"textrazor_newscodes\"])\n```\n\nWe set the API key (which you can generate with a free account on the TextRazor website) and tell the client to use the entities and topics extractors. We also set the classifiers to `textrazor_newscodes`. [Find out more on TextRazor's Classification page](https://www.textrazor.com/classification).\n\n### 2. Function for loading the language model via a pipeline using zero shot classification, the classification process, plotting the results, and web scraping\n\n```python\n# Load model\n@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)\ndef load_model():\n  return pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\", \n  model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9', \n  multi_label=True)\n\n# Classification function\ndef classify(sequences, candidate_labels):\n  output_results = load_model()(sequences=sequences,\n    candidate_labels=candidate_labels)\n  return output_results['labels'], output_results['scores']\n\n# Graph plot function\ndef plot_result(top_topics, scores):\n  top_topics = np.array(top_topics)\n  scores = np.array(scores)\n  scores *= 100\n  fig = px.bar(x=scores, \n    y=top_topics,\n    orientation='h', \n    labels={'x': 'Confidence', 'y': 'Label'},\n    text=scores,\n    range_x=(0,115),\n    title='Top Predictions',\n    color=np.linspace(0,1,len(scores)),\n    color_continuous_scale='GnBu')\n  fig.update(layout_coloraxis_showscale=False)\n  fig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:0.1f}%',\n  textposition='outside')\n  st.plotly_chart(fig)\n\ndef req(url):\n  resp = requests.get(url)\n  soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')\n  if soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\") or soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\"):\n    remove_comments = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"comments\")\n    remove_comments.extract()\n    remove_secondary = soup.find(\"div\", id=\"secondary\")\n    remove_secondary.extract()\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n  else:\n    ext_t = [t.text for t in soup.find_all(['h1', 'p'])]\n    paragraphs = ' '.join(ext_t)\n    return paragraphs\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n  with st.spinner('Classifying...'):\n    global txt\n    df_classify_topic = pd.DataFrame(topics_dict)\n    df_classify_topic = df_classify_topic.sort_values(\n      by='Relevance Score', ascending=False)\n    classify_topic_score = list(\n      df_classify_topic['Topic'][:10])\n    if input_type == 'Text':\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'URL':\n      txt = req(url)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n    elif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n      txt = ' '.join(all_txt)\n      top_topics, scores = classify(\n        txt, classify_topic_score)\n\n  plot_result(top_topics[::-1][-10:], scores[::-1][-10:])\n```\n\nThere's a lot here so I'll break it down further.\n\nThe first function loads the distilbart model for this task and uses zero-shot classification to determine classification. I have also set a cache so it doesn't reload every time, which saves loading time and CPU/GPU resources.\n\nThe second function is for the actual classification. It loads the model, and generates output results containing the labels and the relevance scores for each. Which labels we use are determined later.\n\nThe third function plots a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 labels alongside their scores. This allows us to visualise the best classification labels of the analysed text.\n\nHere's how the model classified this blog post:\n\n![A graph showing 10 labels the language model thinks my blog post is about. For example, the number 1 label is Blog with a 90% score](/images/classification-labels.jpg)\n\nThe fourth function is the URL scraper. It takes a URL, extracts the HTML, ignores any comments sections or text found in sidebars ([thanks to Jess for the help with that](https://twitter.com/jessthebp/status/1496153327779950604)) and finally filters the remaining text down to just the H1 title and text found in p tags, ready for analysis.\n\nThe fifth and final function brings everything together. It creates dataframes out of the found entities and topics and orders them by relevance score for ease.\n\n### 3. Dictionaries\n\n```python\nkw_dict = {\n  'Keyword': []\n}\n\nent_dict = {\n  'Keyword': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ntopics_dict = {\n  'Topic': [],\n  'Relevance Score': [],\n  'Existing Tag': []\n}\n\ncategories_dict = {\n  'Category': [],\n  'Relevance Score': []\n}\n\ntags = {\n  'Tag': [],\n  'ID': [],\n  'Count': []\n}\n```\n\nArguably the easiest part, just setting the dictionaries for our entity outputs as well as the tags for the additional part of our script which is up next.\n\n### 4. Establishing the blogs to cross-reference my entities with their respective tag lists\n\n```python\n# Blog list\nblogs = ['sampleface.co.uk',\n\t'cultrface.co.uk',\n\t'logicface.co.uk',\n\t'playrface.co.uk',\n\t'distantarcade.co.uk']\n\n# Empty lists for existing tags and text from multiple URLs\nexisting_tags = []\nall_txt = []\n\n# Upper limits for tag page range\nupper_limits = {\n  'sampleface.co.uk': 4,\n  'cultrface.co.uk': 4,\n  'logicface.co.uk': 2,\n  'playrface.co.uk': 2,\n  'distantarcade.co.uk': 2,\n  'ld89.org': 1\n}\n```\n\nHere, we introduce the blogs for our content ideas generator using tags from my blogs. I made a list of all 5 blogs to choose, created empty lists to add existing tags and set upper limits for the tag page ranges.\n\nThe tag data comes from WordPress's REST API which lists various elements of a WordPress blog such as tags, categories, posts, and media. For the tags, I can pull data at 100 tags per page but when I need to run the for-loop to pull what I need, I need to set an upper limit (eg. if I have 350 tags, the range would be from 0 to 4).\n\nAlso, I have to set this upper limit manually as I have no way of automating it (but if such a way exists, please let me know!)\n\n### 5. The Streamlit UI stuff\n\n```python\n# Streamlit stuff\n\nst.sidebar.title('Tag suggester')\n\ninput_type = st.sidebar.radio(\n\t'Select your input type',\n\t['Text', 'URL', 'Multiple URLs'])\n\nupdate_tags = st.sidebar.button('↻ Refresh tags')\n\ntag_ideas = st.sidebar.button('Load tag ideas')\n\n\n# Determines input types\nst.title('Welcome to RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)!')\nst.write('This script can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing).')\nif input_type == 'Text':\n  txt = st.text_area('Enter text to be analysed...')\n  txt = txt.replace('\\n', ' ').replace('\"', '').replace('“','').replace('”', '').replace('‘','').replace('’', '').replace(\"'s\", '').replace(\",\", '')\n  st.write(len(txt))\nelif input_type == 'URL':\n  url = st.text_input('Enter URL')\nelif input_type == 'Multiple URLs':\n  multi_url = st.text_area('Enter keywords, 1 per line')\n```\n\nThis displays all the inputs and radio buttons needed to pick the right functionality.\n\n### 6. Functions for updating my tag lists via WordPress's REST API\n\n```python\ndef update_all_tags():\n\n  with st.spinner('Reloading tags...'):\n\n    for blog in blogs:\n    \n      # Get tag data\n      for pg in range(1, upper_limits[blog]+1):\n\n        tag_url = f'https://{blog}/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&page={pg}'\n        r_tag = requests.get(tag_url)\n        api_tags = r_tag.json()\n\n        for n in range(0,len(api_tags)):\n          tags['Tag'].append(api_tags[n]['name'])\n          tags['ID'].append(api_tags[n]['id'])\n          tags['Count'].append(api_tags[n]['count'])\n\n        with open(f\"{blog}.json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n          json.dump(tags, outfile)\n      tags['Tag'] = []\n      tags['ID'] = []\n      tags['Count'] = []\n\nlist_of_blogs = st.radio(\"Select the corresponding blog\", blogs)\n\n# Load JSON files\nwith open(f'{list_of_blogs}.json', 'rb') as f:\n  blog_json = json.load(f)\n  x = blog_json['Tag']\n  for n in x:\n    existing_tags.append(n)\n\nsubmit = st.button('Submit')\n\nif update_tags:\n  update_all_tags()\n```\n\nThere are two functions linked to the tag data. First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won't change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files. These were formerly pickle files but due to the poor security, I spent a few hours switching this code out. I still love pickles though.\n\nFrom there, we can also read those files and add them to our existing_tags list ready for cross referencing against the extracted entities we find.\n\n### 7. The random functions for content ideas\n\n```python\n# Tag ideas functions\n\ndef sf_words():\n\n\twith open(\"sampleface.co.uk.json\") as sf_json_file:\n\t\tsf = json.load(sf_json_file)\n\tsf_words_lists = sf['Tag']\n\treturn sf_words_lists\n\ndef cultr_words():\n\n\twith open(\"cultrface.co.uk.json\") as cf_json_file:\n\t\tcf = json.load(cf_json_file)\n\tcf_words_lists = cf['Tag']\n\treturn cf_words_lists\n\ndef logic_words():\n\n\twith open(\"logicface.co.uk.json\") as lf_json_file:\n\t\tlf = json.load(lf_json_file)\n\tlf_words_lists = lf['Tag']\n\treturn lf_words_lists\n\ndef playr_words():\n\n\twith open(\"playrface.co.uk.json\") as pf_json_file:\n\t\tpf = json.load(pf_json_file)\n\tpf_words_lists = pf['Tag']\n\treturn pf_words_lists\n\ndef da_words():\n\n\twith open(\"distantarcade.co.uk.json\") as da_json_file:\n\t\tda = json.load(da_json_file)\n\tda_words_lists = da['Tag']\n\treturn da_words_lists\n\nall_words_list = [sf_words(), cultr_words(), logic_words(), playr_words(), da_words()]\n\ndef sampleface():\n\n\tst.header('Sampleface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"sampleface.co.uk.json\") as sf_json_file:\n\t\t\tsf = json.load(sf_json_file)\n\t\tsf_words_count_lists = sf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in sf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t\t# sf_choices = random.choices(sf_words_count_lists, weights=(1/n), k=2)\n\t\tsample = random.choices(sf_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\t\ndef cultrface():\n\n\tst.header('Cultrface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"cultrface.co.uk.json\") as cf_json_file:\n\t\t\tcf = json.load(cf_json_file)\n\t\tcf_words_count_lists = cf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in cf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t\t# sf_choices = random.choices(sf_words_count_lists, weights=(1/n), k=2)\n\t\tsample = random.choices(cultr_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef logicface():\n\n\tst.header('LOGiCFACE ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"logicface.co.uk.json\") as lf_json_file:\n\t\t\tlf = json.load(lf_json_file)\n\t\tlf_words_count_lists = lf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in lf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(logic_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef playrface():\n\n\tst.header('Playrface ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"playrface.co.uk.json\") as pf_json_file:\n\t\t\tpf = json.load(pf_json_file)\n\t\tpf_words_count_lists = pf['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in pf_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(playr_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef distantarcade():\n\n\tst.header('Distant Arcade ideas')\n\n\tfor sample in range(5):\n\t\twith open(\"distantarcade.co.uk.json\") as da_json_file:\n\t\t\tda = json.load(da_json_file)\n\t\tda_words_count_lists = da['Count']\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tx = [n/(n+1) for n in da_words_count_lists]\n\t\texcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\tsample = random.choices(da_words(), x, k=2)\n\t\t\n\t\tst.write('https://google.com/search?q=' + '+'.join(sample).lower().replace(' ', '+').replace('&', ''))\n\ndef all_blogs():\n\n\tsampleface()\n\tcultrface()\n\tlogicface()\n\tplayrface()\n\tdistantarcade()\n```\n\nI'll try to summarise this part as it is quite lengthy. Each JSON file is read and the relevant list is pulled containing all the respective blogs' tags. To generate the Google Search URLs, a for-loop picks out the tags' counts and generates a new list which can be used for weighting in the random.choices method. Then a series of 2-3 tags are chosen at random, weighted by least used tag = most likely chosen and appended to the Google Search URL.\n\nFinally, they're all grouped together in a main function ready to be called at the click of a button.\n\n### 8.

I set a threshold for the relevance score to ignore anything that had a score of 0. I also added a check for matching tags, so if an entity is already in my tag list, it'll give me a 1 or 0 if not. It's worth noting that this is inconsistent despite my best efforts so if you see the code and can tell me how to do this better, let me know!\n\n### 9.

The data is aggregated by relevance score (if multiple instances of an entity are found, I get the mean relevance score), and the max value of existing tags (1 or 0). For multiple URLs, I've used describe() to give me a full range of statistical data. Most of it is superfluous but it was the best thing I could find to get the data I needed.\n\nBelow is a table of the top 5 entities found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Keyword     \t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score | Existing tag |\n| -----------------------------\t| --------------- | ------------ |\n| Website      \t\t\t\t\t| 0.6620       \t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Search engine optimization    | 0.6460          | 0\t\t\t |\n| Web scraping\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6450\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| World Wide Website\t\t\t| 0.6440\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| HTML\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6320\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n\nA table of the top 5 topics found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Topic     \t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score | Existing tag |\n| -----------------------------\t| --------------- | ------------ |\n| API      \t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000       \t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Blog    \t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000          | 0\t\t\t |\n| Computer science\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 1\t\t\t |\n| Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n| Google Search\t\t\t\t\t| 1.0000\t\t  | 0\t\t\t |\n\nAnd a table of the top 5 categories found in this blog post, ordered by relevance score:\n\n| Category     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Relevance Score |\n| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\t| --------------- |\n| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology      \t\t| 0.8100\t\t  | \n| economy, business and finance>computing and information technology>software  \t| 0.7330\t\t  |\n| arts, culture and entertainment>internet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.6020\t\t  |\n| arts, culture and entertainment>language\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.5620\t\t  |\n| science and technology>engineering\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 0.5360\t\t  |\n\n### 10.

This isn't fine-tuned in anyway so its classification could be improved if you trained the model on specific datasets.\n\nThere are also no means of downloading the outputted data.

Let’s look at some definitions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Entities - Real-world objects, such as people, organisations, locations, products, that can be denoted with a proper name. They can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include: Python, London, David Beckham, Nelson Mandela, Manchester United, The Simpsons, cooking.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Topics - These are broader terms that can describe wider ranges of ideas. Examples of topics include: American sitcoms, British footballers, programming languages, capital cities, world leaders, television series. Sometimes an entity can be a topic. In the specific context of the Text Razor API, a topic is more specific than a category and TextRazor has “an automatic understanding of hundreds of thousands of different topics at different levels of abstraction”.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Categories - The term “categories” is sometimes used interchangably with topics but in this context, a category is a broader term with which an entity and/or topic can fall under. Examples of categories include: arts, culture and entertainment > animation; health > hospital and clinic; economy, business and finance > media > advertising\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Text classification - the task of assigning a document or text to one or more classes, categories, or labels. In NLP, this can be done manually or programmatically.

First is a function that pulls the tag name, tag ID, and how many posts have been assigned to that tag and adds them to a dictionary. This is then saved to a JSON file for offline use. Doing this avoids making multiple API calls since, theoretically, the tag data won’t change that frequently. But when it does change, you can refresh the JSON files.

We might not be doing these exact things but are we still looking for quick-win tricks without a robust strategy or test to back them up? And how conclusive is any of what we're thinking of doing?

Most of the songs could be traced back to a song already released, but updated for 2010 and I think this really caters for both the hardcore fan who might have been disillusioned with Dynamite and Jamiroquai’s move from its organic roots and the weekend fan who just wants to boogie on down to some crazy cosmic funk.\n\nWhat I really like about this one is that it fills in any gaps made from the other releases: Emergency on Planet Earth covered acid jazz and some early funk, Return of the Space Cowboy did the same but more so with the funk and the blaxploitation era music it seemed clearly inspired by, Travelling Without Moving, their magnum opus, the biggest selling funk album of all time, Synkronized with their move to disco and soul and a more electronic approach which leaked into A Funk Odyssey and Dynamite. With funk, soul, acid jazz and disco all covered, what would be left to do? Rock and a bit of house of course, and you get a bit of both in RDLS, with the usual repeat offenders. Would you have them any other way?\n\nSo here’s my track-by-track summary. Feel free to agree or disagree and then repeat the sentiment when you read my conclusion.\n\n## 1. Rock Dust Light Star\n\nThe title track, maybe a little weak for my personal tastes. It doesn’t provide the kind of punch I would have hoped for after five years out. Fortunately, I’m an enormous fan and knew the next track was going to be superb so I listened on. The live offering is significantly better, but this one eases you in if you’re a new listener, but won’t blow you away.\n\n**Similar song**: Couldn’t really think of one.\n\n**Rating**: 6/10\n\n## 2. White Knuckle Ride\n\nIt’s funk, it’s house, it’s “high-octane”, it’s Jamiroquai. If it wasn’t for track 8, this would have been my track of the year. It’s infectious and contains the classic lyric you can repeat over and over: “Pressure, it’s not so easy to control”. A response to the music industry from Jay Kay, it really hits the spot and proves to the critics and haters that the band (not just the front man) still have what it takes since Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat all those years ago.\n\n**Similar song**: Cosmic Girl from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 3. Smoke and Mirrors\n\nSomeone pointed out to me that this had a real acid jazz feel about it, and I couldn’t agree more and something I noticed immediately about it was the return of the horn section. A grumble amongst of a lot of fans was the exclusion of the horn section from a lot of the tracks from the past two albums. It’s a welcome return and it’s the first throwback track to the Golden Age of 1992-1994.\n\n**Similar song**: Hooked Up from Emergency on Planet Earth\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 4. All Good In The Hood\n\nI remembered chuckling to myself at this title (in my head because it wasn’t funny enough to laugh out loud). It sounds very 70s and low and behold, this one is. Certainly reminds me of Soul Education and the old soul/funk vibe of the time and in some ways this song could be seen as a soul education, a genre that hasn’t really had anyone fighting for it in recent years thanks to the joy that is commercial dance and what people insist on calling R&B (separate rant for a separate day).\n\n**Similar song**:  Soul Education from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 5. Hurtin’\n\nThis track may be a little hard to swallow for the hardcore fans. Why? Well, for a start, Jay Kay seems like he’s doing an impression of Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones and for the cynic in some, they sound like a tired rock band. I agree with the former only. For me, it’s their second full foray into a genre they’ve only gently touched on over the years with Deeper Underground and Radio from their Greatest Hits. Of course, their first foray, Feels Just Like It Should, opened the previous album and was met with a bit of a Marmite response because it was too rocky for some, but I liked it and I like this one. Again, another 70s throwback and for me it works. How the hell did I lose ya? I’ll leave that question up to you, folks.\n\n**Similar song**: Feels Just Like It Should from Dynamite\n\n**Rating**: 8/10\n\n## 6. Blue Skies\n\nWhat… a Jamiroquai ballad? That sounds modern? Good heavens, this can’t be right. Well it is. And it’s damn good. I really love this song, the slight vibrato on some of the end notes (something I’ve personally longed for for quite a while), the slower pace to relax to, not to mention the fact that it proves that they aren’t just one trick ponies. The amount of times I’ve heard people say “they sing the same stuff over and over” to which I’d reply “yeah, because they’re a funk band. You don’t say that about James Brown, do you?”. I haven’t said that yet, but I will one day. It’s a track that, if released by any pop star, upcoming or otherwise, it’d be a hit. Due to poor marketing and the fact it’s Jay Kay and his band as people like to refer to it as, this didn’t. It’s a shame because it’s definitely a radio favourite.\n\n**Similar song**: This one is an original, but it has ballady elements of Falling from Synkronized.\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## 7. Lifeline\n\nThere seems to be two parts to this song: the country/rock/Motown vibe the verses carry along and the big band choruses. Might sound a bit weary from that description, but it does work. It’s a love song and for many, love songs are cheesy apart from the one that describes you and your partner. Luckily for me, this one does in a way (apart from the bit where it says my mother said we’d break up. That never happened). It’s nice and yet another radio favourite, but this one is probably destined for the Radio 2 playlist as opposed to the Radio 1/Heart FM listeners.\n\n**Similar song**: A 70s rock version of You Are My Love from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 8. She’s a Fast Persuader\n\nThis. Song. Rocks. My. Socks. Into. Space. I’m getting goosebumps just from writing about it. I doubt anyone on the planet or the universe can share that feeling but this track is absolutely awesome (I’m going to use a lot of astronomy words in this summary so stay with me). The opening spacey chords that lead into the opening drum beat (that fans will know from Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing, an instrumental that didn’t quite make the Synkronized album but can be found here) and the synth bass… eargasmic. It’s really the chords that do it for me and the electric guitar, very 80s and very very good. This is the reason why White Knuckle Ride is my second favourite track of the year. This is what Jamiroquai do best and this is why I still love them.\n\n**Similar song**: Space Cowboy (from Return of the Space Cowboy) mixed Feels So Good from A Funk Odyssey\n\n**Rating**: 10/10\n\n## 9. Two Completely Different Things\n\nJay Kay says it’s from Synkronized, Matt Johnson says it’s from Dynamite. It has elements of both albums but I’d probably side with Matt on this one. It’s very summery and feel good. You can certainly tell they had fun on this one and it’d be a good track to wake up to, providing you ignored the lyrics if you were waking up with a girlfriend.\n\n**Similar song**: A slower summery version of Where Do We Go From Here from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 10. Goodbye To My Dancer\n\nAnother title that had me laughing and scratching my head (this time I actually acted on my thoughts, but still didn’t laugh out loud) but I needn’t. For me, it’s one of the best fillers on this album. It has a mournful sound and takes an upfront approach in terms of the percussion section, a part of Jamiroquai sounds that goes unnoticed sometimes and by percussion, I mean Sola Akingbola as opposed to Derrick McKenzie (that man is a drumming beast!). It has a African/Latin kind of feel, which could be an overflow from the previous track and it works.\n\n**Similar song**: Can’t think, feel free to help me out here\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n## 11. Never Gonna Be Another\n\nThis one almost copies the chords from the previous tracks and adds to the melancholy. It’s sad and it hits the spot, so regardless of taste, it does its job well. Very quiet, spacey (in a different kind of way to Persuader) and low on production, it’s a good break up song if you’re tired of Boyz II Men End Of The Road (I know some people would call that viewpoint blasphemous but come on, this is 2010 and you’re not 14 anymore).\n\n**Similar song**: Spend A Lifetime from Travelling Without Moving\n\n**Rating**: 6.5/10\n\n## 12. Hey Floyd\n\nNow this is how you finish an album. Grand, majestic and multi-layered. It’d find a place on Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey or even Dynamite which makes it good enough to cover 12 years of music despite it being another 70s tribute. It starts off as a sermon to the titular Floyd who’s got his mind in a mess again; possibly the boy who was mentioned in Just Another Story, who knows. The song then moves into a reggae interlude, which is a perfect layer and something Jamiroquai have done sparingly but to great effect. When the original beat comes back though, it comes back heavy and hard, like a slap in the face much similar to what Floyd would probably be getting if he were real and I wasn’t treating this review like some kind of poetry analysis for my English Literature GCSE coursework.\n\nSimliar song: Just Another Story from Return of the Space Cowboy and Black Capricorn Day from Synkronized\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI’ve excluded the bonus tracks as they are just live versions or remixes. All in all, this is a decent release from the band many thought couldn’t do it anymore. People wanted something new and they got it on some tracks. People wanted the old stuff back and they got that in abundance. Everyone should be happy, right? Wrong. The usual haters will continue to hate the wrong people:\n\n> “That Jamiroquai pisses me off he does. Sorry, he? Jamiroquai is the band. You mean Jay Kay.”\n\nA common conversation and very annoying. Sure he fronts the band and he’s received most airtime over the years but he does write the music, along with the other band members and it’s not like the band have never featured in interviews or in videos. But I’m digressing from the main point.\n\nThis is a good comeback and with decent promotion, this would have got higher than number 7. It’s a more live and organic offering than in previous years and some may not like it but it’s better than them stagnating in the 90s. They’re behaving more like an indie band, which I don’t mind too much but it has affected their marketing and has probably hurt their initial album sales but perhaps Jay Kay doesn’t care and just wants to perform. A unique take for such a big band in this day and age but it certainly keeps the mega fans happy, me included. The average mark should be 7.8 but the album as a whole warrants 8/10. It’s a better album than it is an album of hits like a lot of albums out currently but either way, it’s going to be a white knuckle ride.\n\n**Final rating**: 8/10","src/content/posts/jamiroquai-rock-dust-light-star-review.md","f42b783fc55ef5f8",{"html":4444,"metadata":4445},"\u003Ch2 id=\"here-it-is-theres-no-way-to-make-it-better\">“Here it is, there’s no way to make it better.”\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One of the opening lines to White Knuckle Ride, the debut single of Jamiroquai’s seventh studio album Rock Dust Light Star.

Whether it be for his impeccable choice of samples through a multitude of different styles, his uncanny knack of blowing your mind with his musicianship or his humility in a sea of egos and gold chains, he is revered as a legend beyond the realms of hip-hop music, and rightfully so. But perhaps something that he doesn’t get enough credit for, publicly at least, is his drumming techniques, both acoustic and digital.

His technique started similarly to his peers of the time. The early ’90s gave birth to “jazz rap” and the complementing drum breaks that came with it, thanks to Prince Paul and A Tribe Called Quest. By 1993, Tribe and co. had moved onto free drumming, in the pocket, classic boom bap.\n\nWhen it came time for Dilla to show what he had to offer on a major stage for The Pharcyde, it was 1995 and a year after what is known by fans as the “Second Golden Age” period of 1993-1994. “Runnin’” heralded the start of an illustrious career. Producing under the name “Jay Dee,” his music triggered the attention of Q-Tip and he managed to acquire his services for Tribe’s final two albums. Despite the internal strife Tribe were experiencing, Jay Dee, now performing under the collective name of The Ummah, let his music do the talking. Unlike the drum programming on Labcabincalifornia, the patterns on Beats, Rhymes & Life and The Love Movement were a lot looser, slightly off time at moments. This apparent “sloppiness” was no accident, however. Jay was playing it human. Allowing the kicks and snares to be slightly out of time moved the percussion aware from a machine feel and gave added weight to the swing and soul of the music. The two albums he featured on weren’t met with the same acclaim as the first three Tribe albums but that was more due to the ongoing strife between Tip and Phife as opposed to Jay Dee’s production quality.\n\nQuestlove once told XXL Magazine a story of how Dilla had used a beaten up drum kit on the Donald Byrd cover “Think Twice” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla had used a vibraphone mallet and a broken drumstick with toilet paper and rubber bands wrapped around it because he didn’t know where to get proper drumsticks late at night. His reasoning for using a mallet was to keep the dynamic less aggressive. Questlove subsequently went out and bought orchestra mallets and tried it out when he had to fly out to Philly. Even before that time, Dilla had been instrumental (pun intended) in the rhythmic and percussive elements of D’Angelo’s Voodoo (although not officially credited), pushing the human element of the drum programming all the way. Questlove clearly learnt a lot from this approach as his performances on the opener “Playa Playa,” for example, exhibits the funky swing of the rimshot against the booming bass drum to give a distinct sound that permeated throughout the whole album. As Quest said himself, “The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.” Talking to Okayplayer, Quest remarked that “Word Play” on Tribe’s Beats, Rhymes & Life singlehandedly changed his thinking towards drumming, because of the sloppiness of the kick, executed with “finesse and defiance.“ Looking at where he is right now in terms of success, that was a pretty big influence.\n\nBy the time Dilla’s second “era” came around, the gritty street feel mixed with the brief beginnings of his electro phase, Karriem Riggins had already known the Detroit producer for five years, having met him through Common in ’96. In that time, he had provided his drumming expertise on “2 U 4 U” and later produced “The Clapper” for Welcome 2 Detroit. Dilla’s influence on Riggins was as profound, maybe more so after the release of his debut album, Alone/Together, which featured the track “J Dilla The Greatest.” “I learned different ways to get certain feels out of the machine, to basically convey an idea,” he told XXL Mag. “Turning the time shifting off and playing the track live. I think his approach was different every time.” Riggins illustrated the point further in a video with Peanut Butter Wolf and J.Rocc. Using the machine, be it a MPC or one of the newer Maschines, as a tool rather than the music maker allowed for more human flexibility in production.\n\nAsk most producers right now some of their main influences and you’ll hear Dilla’s name mentioned pretty much every time. The reason behind this may differ from musician to musician but the general crux of it comes from his approach to the whole process, from start to finish. There’s also an element of curiosity; what sample did he use on that cut, how did he get the snare to sound like that without it being too brash? Video series like Waajeed’s “Bling47 Breaks Dilla Edition” answered some of those burning questions with the purpose to demystify Dilla and his production, according to Waajeed himself. Jazz drummer Damion Reid, talking to NPR Music, expressed his admiration for Dilla’s ability to encompass every element within his compositions, “every drum, every nuance, every atmospheric sound was strategically placed. Jay Dee embodied, to me, the culmination of all those things.” Last year, ERIMAJ released his debut album Conflict Of A Man and featured his take on Dilla’s “Nothing Like This,” one of his most enigmatic works.

But I'm worried he won't emulate Nadal in his title defence as Nadal is stronger on clay than Federer is on grass. Most players \"fall back\" on clay but stay hyper competitive on grass as Wimbledon is the biggest grand slam of the year. I'm probably being premature as I've not seen Federer play on grass yet (he starts tomorrow against Mischa Zverev) but given his choke in Indian Wells, 2nd round defeat in Miami, and then 3 months off, I'm unsure. But I felt that way after his 6 months off in 2016 and he's 3 grand slams up since then so anything is possible.

Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo’s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\n\n## Act 1: Roger Federer\n\n![Roger Federer](/images/esq-roger-federer-wimbledon-2012-xlg.jpeg)\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change – most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many – and he’s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn’t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer’s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn’t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\n\nBut 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\n\nFor me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn’t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I’d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It’s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\n\n## Act 2: J Dilla\n\n![J Dilla](/images/dilla.jpeg)\n\nMy hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn’t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres – hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica – and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\n\nBy now, I’d discovered he’d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to [Donuts](https://sampleface.co.uk/28-days-of-dilla-28-j-dilla-donuts/), didn’t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\n\n## Act 3: Union and Victory\n\n![Roger Federer, Wimbledon Champion 2012](/images/Roger-Federer-Wimbledon-Champion-2012_2792722.jpeg)\n\nBut how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla’s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer’s and Murray’s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn’t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn’t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles’ Hard Day’s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\n\nThe Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. “I knew it”, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad’s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\n\n## Reprise\n\n![J Dilla's basement](/images/4dilla.jpeg)\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting.

Tennis and hip hop rarely come together (bar Drake and Redfoo’s attempts.) But this is completely different. To tell this story, I need to break it down into three parts. Think of it as a concerto, an ode to the greatest to ever do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-1-roger-federer\">Act 1: Roger Federer\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/esq-roger-federer-wimbledon-2012-xlg.jpeg\" alt=\"Roger Federer\">\nThe Question will never go away but the answer is as sure as climate change – most sensible people agree but there are deniers out there with nonsensical arguments. Roger Federer is the greatest and a cult figure if that cult was the Planet Earth. His records speak for themselves - and there are many – and he’s playing at a level most players could only dream of at the age of 34. But in the period between 2010-2012, he didn’t win a single grand slam. Suddenly, there was a new question: is this the end of Federer’s reign at the top? Nadal had continued his dominance on clay and thwarted the Swiss maestro on his own turf: the grass of Wimbledon and added the Australian Open title in 2009. Djokovic had become a rampant force, thanks to a 49 match unbeaten run in 2011 and Murray was slowly pushing towards grand slams, having reached the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open finals (both defeats to Federer.) Cracks were beginning to show in his game. He couldn’t handle the precision of his rivals, not mentally anyway. Unforced errors were creeping in where he winners used to thrive. Wimbledon was no longer a failsafe for him after defeats in the semis and quarters in 2010 and 2011 (the latter having had a 2-0 lead against Tsonga).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But 2012 was different. He overcame Novak Djokovic against the odds in his best performance of the season. An eighth Wimbledon final since 2003 and his opponent was Andy Murray, the darling of British tennis. Federer was the favourite having a winning record over Murray and it being on his hallowed ground so-to-speak but nothing could diminish the British spirit, especially high given the Olympics soon after.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me as a huge Federer fan, it was nerve wracking. I still wasn’t used to this barren period and defeats were like bullets. I’d not felt this close to a sport since the 90s with Man United and even my support for them was waning. I was pessimistic of his chances, even with the (un)biased media backing him for the title. It’s not like I had lost faith in his ability but nothing was guaranteed anymore. In my personal life, things were pretty comfortable so this one impending event was the source of genuine worry. This was the life of a fan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-2-j-dilla\">Act 2: J Dilla\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/dilla.jpeg\" alt=\"J Dilla\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My hip hop journey initially started roughly in 2006 but I wasn’t aware of its impact until much later. It was a compilation featuring a wide range of genres – hip hop, jazz, folk, electronica – and it was the third track, Jealousy by Slum Village, that burrowed under my skin without me realising. The group comprised of three members: T3, Baatin and emcee/producer Jay Dee. I paid enough attention to acknowledge the beat was smooth, the lyrics unremarkable but catered to the rhythm. The next year, I went to university to study Computer Science but dropped out after 6 months. I fell into a state of depression during and after my brief time there and music became the crutch for me. I carried this through and it became my lifeblood. Hip hop was the nucleus and through connections, I came across Jay Dee once again, now known to me as J Dilla.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By now, I’d discovered he’d passed away in 2006, somewhat poignant given the first time I heard his work; circle of life and all that. I listened to \u003Ca href=\"https://sampleface.co.uk/28-days-of-dilla-28-j-dilla-donuts/\">Donuts\u003C/a>, didn’t enjoy it, listened to artists he inspired, came back to it and BOOM! What the HELL was I thinking? The legend behind Donuts lives on and continues to grow with every new anecdote and every year that passes. His music became my new obsession. He was a deft craftsman with an incredible ear for samples, rhythm and arrangement. He knew exactly where things needed to be and when. His unorthodoxy became staples amongst his peers, blowing away colleagues and fans alike with incredible reinterpretations. He was akin to Federer in black music form.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"act-3-union-and-victory\">Act 3: Union and Victory\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Roger-Federer-Wimbledon-Champion-2012_2792722.jpeg\" alt=\"Roger Federer, Wimbledon Champion 2012\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But how on earth does J Dilla come into contact with Roger Federer? Only I could make this connection. During the time of Wimbledon in 2012, I had been listening to some of Dilla’s old bootleg tapes on my way to work. There was one particular song that entranced me on my way home on the Friday before the final. I had just finished watching both Federer’s and Murray’s semis before leaving work and the worry began to set in. What if he doesn’t win? What if this was all for nothing? I couldn’t bear it. The peak of my doubts was offset by Track 16 (these are the names you can expect from bootlegs.) For added context, the beat sampled a psychedelic folksy cover of The Beatles’ Hard Day’s Night which I have yet to find. It was from 2005, during the latter stage of his life before he went to hospital for the last time. By this time, he had let his style expand and become even more organic than before. The drums were gruffer and the samples as dusty and left-field as possible. Track 15 was more subtle, harking back to his laid back Jay Dee days and this became the soundtrack to my Wimbledon summer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Sunday arrived. I had to set my DVD recorder to record the whole programme, including the preamble. I went to visit my dad in hospital in London and could only catch the first set on the radio. It was a unique experience. Murray took an early break and eventually the first set. “I knew it”, I thought. The doubt sunk in again. I watched the rest of the match in my dad’s hospital room with my family. The roof was closed early in the second set which changed the whole dynamic. This was catered for Federer now and the momentum shifted in his direction. He took the next three sets with ease. I watched as he dropped to his knees in ecstasy. The weight of worry was lifted and I could finally relax. Track 15 rang through my head with a new subliminal tone: one of victory.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"reprise\">Reprise\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/4dilla.jpeg\" alt=\"J Dilla&#x27;s basement\">\nFederer has yet to win a grand slam since that wet Sunday afternoon. He’s come close, with three finals (two at Wimbledon) but only one set won in each. It’s likely his champion days are over at that level. I’m still not prepared for grand slam defeats. I don’t think I ever will be. But I have the memories of watching his majesty for 15 years and counting. His extra-curricular activities have made up for some of it and his two sets of twins are adorable. Needless to say, whenever Federer hangs up his racquet, he won’t be leaving the sport completely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As for Dilla, his music lives on in its own right and as inspiration for others.

It won't be as comprehensive as [some of the lists I've read](http://www.toomanywires.co.uk/2024/12/the-best-worst-games-of-2024.html) but I wanted to log my favourites anyway.\n\n## Film of the year: Sonic 3\n\nIt was never going to be anything else, was it? I've been hyped for Sonic 3 since the end of Sonic 2 and I was not disappointed. Sure, the pacing at the start was off and there were some flaws in the film but the latter two thirds of the film were amazing and hit me in all the right places. I plan to go see it again before it leaves the cinema and I don't think I've ever done that with a film. I just want to experience it again.\n\n**Honourable mentions**: Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4\n\n## Game of the year: Tetris Forever/Sonic X Shadow Generations*\n\nOkay so this is awkward. I've only played one game from 2024 and that was Tetris Forever. I could have got Dragon Quest III: 2D-HD but I didn't want to ignore my backlog (it's also why I haven't played TCG Pocket which may have won). But my friend Andrew recommended Tetris Forever and I enjoyed it. BUT I did recently buy Sonic X Shadow Generations and I anticipate loving it so much that it would be the best game I'll have played that was released in 2024.\n\n(Had I chosen *any* game that I'd played in 2024, the winner would have been Breath of Fire IV. The graphics, dialogue, story, and gameplay were so good and it's a shame we've not had anything as good from the franchise since.)\n\n## Book of the year: You Are Here\n\nI read 3 books this year and only one came out this year, that being You Are Here by David Nicholl. It had me so invested, as did all his previous books. I loved the characters and how they warmed to each other and the yearning and soft, encouraging ending was lovely.\n\n## Series of the year: One Day\n\nAnother work by David Nicholl. Based on my favourite book, this is the second live action rendition of One Day after the 2011 film starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. While I liked the film, it was missing some key parts and it didn't feel as close to the book as I wanted. But the series was so good. Every actor nailed their roles, especially Leo Woodall as Dexter Mayhew and Ambika Mod as Emma Morley. I laughed, I cried, I got engrossed in it all and watched some episodes multiple times just to feel something. I don't watch a lot of TV but this kept my attention.\n\n## Streamer of the year: Gronya\n\nFull disclosure: I have been a Twitch subscriber for the past few months and she used some of my music in one of her videos. With that said, I don't care how biased this looks: Gronya rocks. I found her YouTube channel earlier this year thanks to her efforts in helping to preserve the Dragon Quest VII DLC maps before the Nintendo eShop shut down. And then I watched some more videos. And then I reached out with my Dragon Quest-themed album and was surprised that I got a response and that she loved it. And then I found her Twitch channel and the rest is history.\n\nBut enough about me. Gronya has a great sense of humour and her streams are always entertaining, whether she's playing Dragon Quest XI in Draconian Mode or Rocket Slime or the Dragon Quest III remake or performing (yes, she's a musician as well).\n\n**Honourable mention**: Cartoon Therapy\n\n## Album of the year: SiR – HEAVY\n\nThis was a tough call because Justice's Hyperdrama could easily have taken this. And that's not to say it missed the mark in any way but HEAVY enveloped me somehow. I loved all the songs, separately and together, and they made me feel so many emotions. I listened to the album a lot during my trips to Nice visiting my parents and during the times I was traveling on the tram, it kept me company like a good friend. Considering I listened to a fraction of the albums that I listened to the year before, I didn't expect to connect so much to an LP as much as this one. SiR, you knocked it out of the park.\n\n**Honourable mentions**: Justice – Hyperdrama, Khruangbin – A LA SALA, Charlotte Day Wilson – Cyan Blue\n\n## Performance of the year: Beyoncé (Christmas Day Half Time Show)\n\nI was captivated.

Obtaining them has been made a lot easier in recent years, with Dynamax Adventures in Sword & Shield, and Ultra Wormholes in Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon. Those games can take a long time to complete to get there so I figured playing the older games would be a lot quicker.\n\nThat endeavour meant I've played **a lot** of Pokémon and moving them through multiple consoles. This week alone (14th&ndash;20th August 2023), I've done the following:\n\n* Completed Red and caught the Legendary Birds and Mewtwo\n* Completed the first part of Crystal and caught the Legendary Beasts, Lugia, and Ho-Oh\n* Completed Emerald and caught Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, the Regis, Latios, Latias\u003Csup id=\"latias_ref\">\u003Ca href=\"#latias\">**1**\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>, Lugia and Ho-Oh\u003Csup id=\"lugia-ho-oh_ref\">\u003Ca href=\"#lugia-ho-oh\">**2**\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>, Deoxys\u003Csup id=\"deoxys_ref\">\u003Ca href=\"#deoxys\">**3**\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>, and Mew\u003Csup id=\"mew_ref\">\u003Ca href=\"#mew\">**4**\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\n\nIt's been gruelling but worth it as it meant I could finally finish Emerald for the first time (I only ever played Sapphire) and create teams of Pokémon I'd never used before. The most difficult thing to get so far has been the Faraway Island Mew from a Japanese copy of Pokémon Emerald. That involved playing through the game (with help from Google Translate), getting to use the ticket, and then trading it to my English copy of Emerald.

Obtaining them has been made a lot easier in recent years, with Dynamax Adventures in Sword &#x26; Shield, and Ultra Wormholes in Ultra Sun &#x26; Ultra Moon.

I'm not much of a gamer either so it wasn't too difficult to make a list of my five favourites.\n\n## Pokémon Gold/Silver (GBC, 2000)\n\nI didn't think anything could surpass Red/Blue/Yellow and then this came along. I was living in Atlanta when it came out but the buildup was amazing. They had display Gameboy Colors in Target and Walmart and I spent so much time on them. The series introduced some important features that still hold true today: new regions, separation of Special into Special Attack and Special Defence, day and night, breeding, but most importantly, 100 new Pokémon. It has since been remade for the DS and will be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on 22nd September.\n\n## Championship Manager 01/02 (PC, 2001)\n\nI can't for the life of me get into Football Manager. 01/02 holds my heart. I play with updates from the real world as not to feel too archaic and it's the last great game before the change. It's thin on the ground for realistic features but thanks to some special patches, it's not so bad. Playing it vanilla and you get some legendary players who couldn't imitate their \"digital\" careers.\n\n## Super Mario World (SNES, 1990)\n\nOne of my favourite early childhood memories (see F-Zero and Sonic 2 below). I was lucky enough to play it on a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was the best thing in the world. Riding Yoshi was like nothing I had ever done before.\n\n## F-Zero (SNES, 1990)\n\nAnother fond childhood game. I only ever played this at my friend's house as he had a SNES and I wasn't allowed one. It's easily my favourite driving game. Incredible soundtrack, super addictive gameplay and then-state of the art graphics.\n\n## Sonic 2 (Sega Genesis, 1992)\n\nChristmas 1993. My cousins got this for their Sega Genesis. I got to play it and enjoyed every moment. I got to know Sonic before Mario (who I've played more of in my lifetime). It's an instant classic and includes good old Myles Prower.\n\n\u003Cem>Honorable mentions: Mario Tennis (N64), Pokémon Puzzle League (N64), Tetris (GB), Ronaldo V Football (GBC), System Shock 2 (PC), Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes (PC), Super RC Pro-Am (GB)\u003C/em>\n\nI also have [a list of video games that describe me as a gamer](/lists/about-you-video-games/) if you're interested to know more.","src/content/posts/my-five-favourite-video-games-of-all-time.md","48235de91773c724",{"html":4828,"metadata":4829},"\u003Cp>Taken this from a \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/epicgeezr/status/891781690540118018\">viral tweet\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://kottke.org/17/08/my-five-favorite-video-games-of-all-time\">kottke.org\u003C/a>.

My life - at least in my mind - has been defined by thinking about the past, living in the past, and trying to recreate the past. I do the latter as a coping mechanism and an attempt at recapturing lost youth. But I digress. I thought about how I often take a pessimistic approach to think about myself and it infuriates me. So I won't do that here. 2017 has been a shit storm; there's no denying that. But for every roadblock, there has been a pathway through and that's a vast improvement on 2016, the **Year Formerly Known as the Worst Year of My Life.**\n\n## Accepting My Mental Health Problems and Getting Help\n\nBeing a mathematician at heart, I like to think of things in analytical terms. Using a scale of 0-10, I'd give this year an average of 3 and a variance of 5. There have been peaks but plenty of troughs and it's been hell trying to navigate through them. Anyone who follows me on Twitter will have seen my tweets on mental health and some on my own personal life. Despite this, I find it difficult to write about my life in this form. But here we are. People have often remarked at my cool exterior even in moments where others would feel stress. I never used to notice it but now I make sure to maintain this for my own peace of mind. Unfortunately, all that goes out of the window when I enter a stressful situation where I'm tasked with resolving that turmoil. Over the last few years, I have developed anxiety laced with bouts of depression. I've had difficulty controlling my anger during arguments and stressful situations, resorting to the foulest of comments for which I'm ashamed. But anger isn't to blame. I am the sole culprit. Hitting rock bottom leaves you with two choices: stay there for good or find your way back up. I chose the latter. I self referred back to a counselling service and received [CBT](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/) for the first time. I'd received mixed reviews on its effectiveness but I knew it was the appropriate action for my problems. I didn't need medications and anything less than CBT (which I got last December) would have been useless. I had a lovely counsellor who listened and gave me the tools I needed and some food for thought: I needed to be more assertive. It's all a work in progress so I'll let you know at the end of 2018 how I've been doing with that.\n\n## Learning To Be Comfortable Alone After A Breakup\n\nI started the year with a breakup. It was meant to be The Relationship but it hadn't been right for a long time. I played my part and I'm still haunted by some of my actions. I've reached a comfortable plateau with that after a few torrid months in the middle of the year. But amongst all the mess, I learnt how to be okay on my own. I got my own place (more on that later) and found solace in my own space. I still feel lonely at times but then I remember what certain kinds of company I desired would mean and I came to appreciate the environment I was in. I had time to work on my own projects, make my own meals or order in, go out if/when I wanted to - living my life. It was the first time in my life I'd lived on my own and I wouldn't trade it for anything right now. I don't know what the future holds for my love life. I've often segued into relationships or had long stretches being single but yearning for someone but I've not had that this time. Who knows what 2018 will bring. Again, I'll keep you posted.\n\n## Getting My Own Place\n\nI spent the first seven months of the year living with my sister. The change in environment was helpful and I'm so grateful to my sister for that comfort. But I still needed to find my own place. After 6 viewings, I found something 10 minutes from my sister's house and I've loved the place ever since. It's a first floor flat in one of the poshest areas in the city but it's been a dream to live here since I moved. The decor is simple and to my favourite colour scheme: white and grey. It can feel lonely sometimes but it's my home and welcome relief from work. I've laughed to myself more there than I have in years. It's mine.\n\n## I'm Certified, Baby!\n\nMy job hunt has been a nightmare. I've applied for jobs and been turned down due to lack of experience. So what did I do about it? I gained a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing from the Digital Marketing Institute. I started the course in July and graduated in October. One of the highlights of 2017 was finding out I'd passed my final exam. I potentially have a job interview lined up for January but we'll have to see how that goes. Alongside that, I also started freelancing and the income came in handy clearing debts and funding my holiday to Lisbon on my birthday (which I'll discuss in the next paragraph). Movements have been slow and steady but with any luck, I'll win the race in 2018.\n\n## I Got A Break\n\nLisbon. What a city. [I decided to go after reading about it in a magazine](/posts/my-week-in-lisbon/) and the week away was the best time I've ever had. I could merge amongst the crowds without feeling like an outsider. The culture and weather were warm and inviting. Nobody bothered me and I could finally \"be\". Lisbon was a representation of me. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. I explored the places I wanted to see and I visited the best museums I've ever seen. It was a cultural renaissance and opened my mind to a new world, away from everything I knew. I will endeavour to return next year. That's my new \"soul hub\".\n\n## Could \"Pandog Media\" Be The Answer?\n\nI've been [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) for years and started [Sampleface](https://sampleface.co.uk/) as a way to discuss hip hop and sampling in music in 2012. A peak was reached in 2013-14 before work and a lack of time saw the momentum slow. I wanted to open up my repertoire and in 2015, I started [Cultrface](https://cultrface.co.uk/). This year, I started [LOGiCFACE](https://logicface.co.uk/) (in partnership with friend and colleague AJ Brown) and [Playrface](https://playrface.co.uk/). But rather than having 4 blogs operating separately, I needed some cohesion. And that's where Pandog Media came from. It's only a name right now but I plan to flesh things out in 2018. Sampleface was created out of frustration of being made redundant from a music label I worked at and all the resulting blogs and Pandog itself have stemmed from similar frustations. The main one now is constant rejections for work. It's often suggested to blog in your free time if you can't get professional experience but that seems to be ignored during interviews. I've also noticed a lack of diversity within the industry. Agencies are predominately white and yet one of the biggest content hubs on the internet is Black Twitter. A place often pillaged for its content, it only emphasises the deep gulf between the true creators and innovators and the lack of corresponding representation. I'm tired of that and I want that to change. I don't know how right now, but I want to find out. If no one wants to take me on board, I'll take them on instead.\n\nSo that was my year in review. Will 2018 be better? I can only try but no one knows what the future will bring. But I will continue to take things one day at a time and see how many goals I can achieve along the way.","src/content/posts/my-review-of-2017.md","91cc92399d26122a",{"html":4971,"metadata":4972},"\u003Cp>This was going to be a lot more dreary and I wasn’t going to publish anything.

It was a life changing experience and something I will discuss below.\n\nThe inspiration was twofold. I wanted to go away for my birthday this year and rather than take one day off, I decided on taking a whole week off. In hindsight, this was one of the best decision I've made in years. When I decided this, I hadn't considered going away; it was going to be a week to myself and away from work and anything anxiety-inducing. But then I read about Portugal in March's edition of [Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/). They had a 64-page supplement promoting the Iberian nation's virtues and Lisbon was a prominent topic being the capital. They praised the city for its culture and the photos capitivated me. The only other European cities I'd visited were Barcelona, Paris, and Nice - well known cities with strong brands behind them. Lisbon is very much an understated European capital. Rather than experience something familiar, I wanted to try somewhere new and cultural. I booked the hotel and tickets within weeks.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nMy flight was at 4:30pm at London-Luton Airport. I'd travelled down the night before and stayed at my parents' house in Luton. The flight was a little late setting off but getting there was a breeze. The advantage of travelling alone - and by Easyjet - was not having to take responsibility for anyone by myself. I checked in online, bag drop was instantaneous and upon arrival, baggage claim was as quick. The airport had its own Metro station which was convenient and it was easy to navigate. The first thing that amazed me was the ability to use my mobile underground. 1-0 on the tube (although TfL are looking to add 4G coverage now). The journey to my hotel was smooth, although the train didn't go direct so I got off at the nearest stop and walked. I should have changed lines and go another train but it didn't bother me. From my station I walked the mile to my hotel (again, I didn't realise this but it was an easy walk). My room was €345 for 7 nights which I thought was very cheap. The location was yards away from a Metro station with connections to the main areas near the coast and the [Estadio Jose Alvalade](https://www.sporting.pt/en/club/infrastructures/estadio-jose-alvalade). The room itself was compact but ideal for my stay. Everythiing was minimal and to my tastes. I had the best night's sleep in months, if not years.\n\n## Tuesday - Terça-feira\n\nI woke up at around 8ish. Breakfast wasn't included but at €7 a day, it was great value. I didn't fancy anything cooked so I went contintental - cakes, cereal, coffee, and juice. I stocked up and felt content - another first. I'd mentally planned a heap of places to go before coming but I decided to explore and take everything in. I was going to be there for 7 days so there was no immediate rush. In my regular day-to-day life, I find myself rushing through everything n my mind. Work kills my brain and when I leave, I try and savour as much time away as possible before I'm back again. I had no obligations to do anything in Lisbon so I took full advantage. I took a walk from my hotel towards Chiado and Rossio Square and ambled amongst the crowds. One thing I did plan to do was go record shopping. I bought a couple of records and some CDs from a couple of places before hunger set in. I had a lunch-dinner combo at Italian Burger & Lobster House. I gave into my gluttony and had lobster linguine AND an Italian burger. My belly was full for the next day but I had zero regrets. I waddled home via the Metro and counted it as a great day absorbing the Lisboetan ambience. I stayed up past midnight to celebrate my 28th birthday.\n\n## Wednesday - Quarta-feira\n\nMy first ever birthday spent abroad - but what to do? First thing was have breakfast again. I ate what I could after the monumental feast the night before. I had bought tickets to see Sporting CP play Olympiakos in the evening, so I had to find a way to print off my ticket. I found a printers on the way to the stadium but the match wasn't until 7:45pm. I'd picked out a museum to visit and that was my destination after going to the printers. It was only €0.20 to print out the sheet and it took a matter of minutes. I loved how easy and quick everything was in Lisbon. Then to the museum - the [Museu Calouste Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/). There were two parts to the museum: one housed modern Portuguese art from the 20th century onwards and the other classical art from Greco-Roman eras up to 19th century. I spent the majority of my time in the modern art section. The site was a modernist utopia for me. There were elements of Miesian architecture and Brutalism, two styles I adored. It was an inspiring experience walking through and the best way to spend my birthday. I had a couple of \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">\u003Ca href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/7759/recipes-pasteis-de-nata.html\">pasteis de nata]\u003C/a>\u003C/span> for the first time - Lisbon's delicacy and my goodness, it was worth the wait. No custard tart in the UK will ever touch its decadence. After leaving, I headed for Estadio Jose Alvalade for my first ever Champions League match. Getting the stadium was, again, easy and getting inside the stadium wasn't too bad. There was a period of waiting but getting to my seat was a doddle and food inside was remarkably cheap. Only €6-8 or so for a hot dog and a drink. The atmosphere was unique. I'd only ever been to two football matches before, both at Old Trafford and both in nosebleed seats. In Jose Alvalade, I chose a seat behind the dugouts so I could be somewhat equedistant from both goals. There wasn't any nastiness or chanting to throw shade at the opposition, which I preferred to the UK. Sporting ran out 3-1 winners in the end. I left a few minutes before the end to beat the deluge of fans and my journey back was only 20 minutes. The stadium's station was on the same line as my hotel which was perfect. Without question, the best birthday I've ever had.\n\n## Thursday - Quinta-feira\n\nI woke up quite late and decided not to have breakfast. Rain was forecast but I forgot my umbrella when I went out. I needed some underwear and a jumper so I headed to H&M and picked them up. Then the showers came. I was unprepared in my t-shirt so I escaped to the nearest Metro station and headed back to my hotel. I picked up some popcorn on the way (which satiated my sweet tooth and plentiful for €3) and stayed in my room all day. I'd been feeling down that day, partly because my birthday was over but there wasn't anything specifically bothering me - just one of those Mental Health Days. I had a nap in the late afternoon and decided to head out for pizza for dinner. I remembered passing a Turkish pizzaria on my way to the hotel and decided on that. The food and service was lovely. It was a family run business and they were very attentive. I assumed custom wasn't regular so they welcomed my arrival. I had a \u003Cspan lang=\"tr\">\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6rek\">börek\u003C/a>\u003C/span> for starter, a Turkish meat pizza for main, and a baklava for dessert. My mouth is watering thinking about how good they all tasted. One thing caught my attention as I ate. A customer made a takeaway order in Spanish. The restaurant owner and his son took the order and responded in Portuguese and the customer understood. I found this fascinating as between them, they could speak Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and English. I admire multilinguists so much so I loved watching them converse. Besides the washed out day, it wasn't a total waste and I got some new clothes.\n\n## Friday - Sexta-feira\n\nNo rain forecast. No breakfast again but my plans were made in the morning. I wanted to visit [MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)](https://www.maat.pt/en). It was another two-building complex, with the technology part in the modernised Tejo Power Station station and the art in the newly-designed kunsthall. The latter featured in Monocle and drew me to the city immediately. It's reminscient of Birmingham's Bullring but with a scale-like texture. Inside is magnificent. There are two floors of exhibitions and I enjoyed both. It was my kind of minimalism and I bought a few things from the giftshop. I sat outside for a few minutes and took in the view of the Belém coastline. It was a little breezy but the landscape instilled warmth. What I would have given to stay there forever. For dinner, I found a Mexican restaurant called [Las Ficheras](https://www.las-ficheras.pt/). Great prices, scrumptious food, and speedy service. The quesadillas were superb.\n\n## Saturday - Sábado\n\nThe rain came but before I left my hotel. I had breakfast this time, before they closed. I was feeling a little sad as this was one of my last days but I didn't stay in the doldrums for long. I returned to Belém for the [Museu Coleção Berardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berardo_Collection_Museum), a collection of modern art by Portuguese businessman, Joe Berardo. The collection is held at Centro Cultural de Belém which itself is a glorious piece of architecture. Berardo is a renowned art collector so it didn't surprise me to see the likes of Mondrian, Picasso, Warhol, Dalí and Pollock. It was another culturally enriching experience and a great way to spend a Saturday - plus it was free entry! I had dinner at [Este Oeste](https://www.instagram.com/este_oeste/), a sushi-pizza bar in the centre. Prices were decent given the type of food and it was excellent. I had sushi and pizza (because YOLO) and a tiramisu for pudding. I remember thinking I could get used to this life. \n\n## Sunday - Domingo\n\nMy last day. No breakfast again. I decided to visit the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado (or **MNAC** for short, but not to be confused with Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) since entry was only €4. Unfortunately, only the temporary exhibitions were avilable which weren't to my tastes. I did have lunch in their quirky cafe named Spleen. A €13 buffet wasn't to be ignored and the food was finally more akin to Portuguese cuisine to what I had been before. It also rekindled my love of yoghurt and honey which I've since had quite a bit of upon my return. It was the most European meal I'd ever had and I loved it. With most of the day still left, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I got on the Metro and got off when I wanted. In the end, I went back to the São Sebastião station, where I was on Wednesday to visit Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. Out of station, you come into El Corte Inglés, a English-style department store. I wanted to take in the movement and atmosphere of the Lisboetas for one last time so I walked through every floor with no intention to buy anything. Except I did. I noticed the toy department and before it, the Christmas decorations. Their selection was abundant and vibrant with colour. I picked up a pendant bauble for €4. That's when my Christmas spirit kicked in and overrode my sadness of leaving. That was a lovely part of the day.\n\n## Monday - Segunda-feira\n\nI bid farewell to the hotel. No breakfast as I had to leave early. The Metro ride was prompt, getting through customs was brief and the plane ride home was without a hitch. I felt the sting of being back in England when I bought a train ticket back to my parents' nearest station. Metro rides were €1.80 per single. This train ticket for two stops cost over £5.\n\nAs I said earlier, Lisbon is an understated capital. It has virtues that rival its nearby peers like Barcelona and Paris but I quite like its humble nature. That's why it resonated so much with me before and during my stay. I found myself in the city in more ways than one and it was the happiest I'd been in 5 years. It's definitely my #1 destination in the world and somewhere I'd love to live in the future. I wasn't able to use any of my spoken Portuguese while I was out there but I brushed up on my reading and listening. Lisbon has a place in my heart and I plan to be part of it again very soon. If you want a relaxing, uncrowded getaway, bursting with culture, food and Mediterranean weather, Lisbon is the place for you.","src/content/posts/my-week-in-lisbon.md","72b5e6c2edec72b5",{"html":5124,"metadata":5125},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/MAAT-Lisbon-Amanda-Levet-Architects-0016_1.png\" alt=\"MAAT (Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology)\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From 20th - 27th November, I spent a week in Lisbon.

It's not that I'm ashamed of my [neurodivergence](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent) (ND) but rather the fact that I'm self-diagnosing and people LOVE to say *something*.\n\nBut how did I get here? Well, seeing as a professional diagnosis would either involve a 2-year+ wait on the NHS or a 1–2 year wait if I went private and cost me about £2,000, I decided to do some online tests. Before you say anything, I know these aren't any kind of \"proof\" but they're good indicators and I did three of them to get a better overview.\n\nThe scores all came out high.\n\n* 42 in the [AQ test](https://embrace-autism.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/) (threshold is 26)\n* 129 in the [RAADS–R test](https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/) (threshold is 65)\n* 138 in the [CAT-Q test](https://embrace-autism.com/cat-q/) (threshold is 100)\n* 44 in the [RBQ-2A test](https://embrace-autism.com/rbq-2a/) (threshold is 26; 36 is the average autistic score)\n\n4 tests above the threshold has to count for something, right? I'll speak to a doctor eventually but my circumstances will be changing soon so I'll need to register with a new surgery to the one I'm at now. When things are settled, I'll do that. In the meantime, I'm self-diagnosing.\n\nIn terms of why I'm saying \"probably\" autistic... it's because I'd feel more comfortable with an official diagnosis. I know I definitely fall into the neurodivergent category; nothing typical about me on that front! I'm still navigating all of these thoughts and feelings, piecing together years of wondering what was \"wrong\" with me or why people said certain things about me and whether they were true. But the autistic traits I've been reading about have definitely answered some life long questions.\n\nBesides declaring all this, I also wanted to write out something pointers for people who read this and ever interact with me. Because I'm ND, I don't engage with people or things in the same way and as I would respect other people's way of being, I want the same for me. So here's a list of things ([because I love lists, duh!](/lists/)) about me which I'll update as an when I remember them.\n\n## 1. I get overwhelmed easily\n\nThis is gotten really bad lately. Multi-tasking is not my thing, which means working in an agency across multiple accounts is difficult at times. I try my best to plan things out but I also just want to get things done. Here, I'd say if you ever need something from me, it's best to ask if I'm available, be super clear on what you want, and when you want it and do it all within the first request. Vague openers usually give me anxiety and I might feel pressure to commit.\n\n## 2. I don't like small talk or \"networking\"\n\nI'll do small talk with my mum because it's safe and easy. I can't do it with strangers because I have no idea what people really think or feel when talking to me, and I've had comments based on my appearance from the get-go (gotta love casual racism). That's not to say I want deep, meaningful conversations immediately&mdash;or ever&mdash;but the truth is I get nervous when I have to talk to people. I feel like I waffle and that I'm putting on an act, as if I'm pretending to be a \"normal\" human being. I used to be better in like 2019 but it's gotten worse since the pandemic (understandable trust issues!!!) and my social anxiety is at an all-time high. I have nothing to recommend here. It's a social \"thing\" to have icebreakers and group work and small talk and I don't see that ever stopping, even if there are probably tests showing they don't work as well. But if you have an opportunity to not do those things and accommodate for ND people, do it. Because that's the inclusive part of \"diversity and inclusion\".\n\n## 3. My short term memory sucks\n\nYou know when you go into a room and forget why you're there? Well, imagine that but it's pretty much every time you go into a room. I have to sometimes say what I'm there for over and over in my head like a Buddhist chant. I get distracted more than ever before and, while I think I can return my focus to the thing I was meant to do, it doesn't always happen. I hate it. And I've already forgotten what the next part should be while writing this!\n\n## 4. I prefer to work alone\n\nAll the things you've ever see me create? 99.9% of it was done alone. I don't like to rely on people too much as I appreciate we all have lives to live and can't definitely commit. That means if I know I need something and I can do it myself, I will. And so I work alone and find a way where I can. Working with one other person works for me but whole groups with multiple voices? I'm not good at it and I don't feel like I should assimilate because \"that's just how it's done\". Reject tradition; embrace chaos!\n\n## 5. I need detailed explanations\n\nI've had to learn how to read between the lines when people ask me to do things or tell me stuff. But it's very tiring and I don't always get what people are trying to say. So I need detailed explanations if you want me to do something for you. Vagueness confuses me or will lead me to try a method that takes more time than I should spend on the task. That doesn't necessarily mean hand-holding but I tend to get flustered if I go down a path and get told that I'm doing it wrong or \"why are you doing it that way?!\"\n\n## 6. I hyperfocus a lot\n\nI love learning, especially if I find something cool. But that can lead to hyperfocusing, which means I'll hone in on something and spend hours getting into it. Building this website is an example of that. I spent hours over weeks in 2021 putting this site together and learning Astro. Same goes for Neo4j and graph science. And Python. Even Pokémon back when I was young (although that's probably not indicative to autism as it's Pokémon after all lol). Hyperfocusing has lead me to build knowledge in a lot of areas but the downside is creating time sinks where I could be doing literally anything else. Like resting. Less sleep is not good, no matter what people tell you.\n\n## 7. Too much noise gives me sensory overload\n\nI like my peace and quiet a lot of the time. So when I'm in a shopping centre or at work or even at home where my son watches TV at a loud volume and then plays on his Switch at near full volume, it gets too much. It's why I often have headphones in as a way to regulate the sounds I hear. Sensory overload often turns into irritability so if you catch me in that funk, give me a second.\n\n**Sidenote**: _if you have any comments about this, for yourself, and we know each other, feel free to talk to me. If you have any criticisms, keep them to yourself. If you have any advice, ask me whether I'm open to this first. I don't like unsolicited advice as it often comes from a different life experience to mine and the rapport is almost never established beforehand so it sounds like someone offering a smile, a biscuit, and a cup of tea for mental health issues. I've been accused of being standoffish and aloof many times before when I've actually been struggling and nobody thought to check in first. Don't be that person._\n\n## Resources\n\n* [How I get shit done (or at least get started) while having executive dysfunction](https://www.autisticasfxxk.com/blog/get-shit-done/) - This is sound advice for any other neurodivergent folks reading this\n* [As an Autistic Psychologist, Here Are My Thoughts on Autism and Self-Diagnosis](https://www.verywellmind.com/self-diagnosis-according-to-an-autistic-psychologist-8650879) - This is so helpful!","src/content/posts/probably-autistic.md","c230b3ca8bab1c6a",{"html":5328,"metadata":5329},"\u003Cp>My name is Luke and I’m Probably Autistic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been wanting to write this for months but been afraid of what (neurotypical) people might say.

WordPress is easier for larger sites and Astro is the latest static site generator I've used for my personal site.

For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?\n\nOn this site, I just use Sublime Text and write it out manually.

I remember where I was and what I was doing that evening and for the next few days trying to process it all. One of the most surreal weeks of my life. I'd only become a fan in 2003 after watching this video but it changed my life, no exaggeration:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU\n\nI've told this story about a million times but I'm gonna tell it again. I was on the floor watching TV in my parents' house. The advert had been on before but I'd not really paid attention but this time I did. Because it was 2003, Michael was past his \"commercial prime\" as it were. Invincible was undersold to his standards and the allegations had ruined him along with his plastic surgery and vitiligo (perceived as skin bleaching to make himself white.) The tabloids had crushed him and he just wasn't the same. My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I'd never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn't until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was \"WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn't human!\" but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn't keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life. From that very moment on, I **NEEDED** that CD, I needed to see that advert again and I needed everything he made. This was before YouTube existed so I had to wait for the advert to be on TV and eventually it happened and I was awestruck again.    \n       \nAfter getting the Number Ones album, I got Dangerous, then HIStory and the obsession continued. I started playing my mum's records when my parents were out. I'd practice the Billie Jean dance routine from my sister's video ([this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiP9kPEpZ4)) to the point where I warped the carpets and they had to be replaced (my parents never found out the real reason why.) I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I'd never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn't believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I'd never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I'd revered and loved so much - gone.

I remember where I was and what I was doing that evening and for the next few days trying to process it all. One of the most surreal weeks of my life. I’d only become a fan in 2003 after watching this video but it changed my life, no exaggeration:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3HiuWl_WBU\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve told this story about a million times but I’m gonna tell it again. I was on the floor watching TV in my parents’ house. The advert had been on before but I’d not really paid attention but this time I did. Because it was 2003, Michael was past his “commercial prime” as it were. Invincible was undersold to his standards and the allegations had ruined him along with his plastic surgery and vitiligo (perceived as skin bleaching to make himself white.) The tabloids had crushed him and he just wasn’t the same. My mum and sister loved him and there were records in the house and an old video of one of his performances but I’d never listened to them until after this one moment. It wasn’t until about 0:23 when my interest fully piqued. The spin from Smooth Criminal. My first thought was “WTF? Was that a robot? That spin wasn’t human!” but before I could even process it, the clip was followed by the tap dance routine from the Black Panther outro of Black or White. I couldn’t keep up - how the hell was he dancing like that? I had never seen dancing like it before in my life. From that very moment on, I \u003Cstrong>NEEDED\u003C/strong> that CD, I needed to see that advert again and I needed everything he made. This was before YouTube existed so I had to wait for the advert to be on TV and eventually it happened and I was awestruck again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After getting the Number Ones album, I got Dangerous, then HIStory and the obsession continued. I started playing my mum’s records when my parents were out. I’d practice the Billie Jean dance routine from my sister’s video (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiP9kPEpZ4\">this one\u003C/a>) to the point where I warped the carpets and they had to be replaced (my parents never found out the real reason why.) I was stanning hard for YEARS. This was a musical renaissance for me as I’d never taken that much interest in it before. By 2009, I was already going to dance classes and throwing in some MJ moves during breaks. The night he died numbed me to the core. I was at home and my friends from my dance class were practicing in the city centre. They couldn’t believe it. The next day when it finally hit me, there was a massive rain storm. I broke down in tears to the point I could barely stand as the rain tumbled down. I’d never felt so heartbroken about anything. An artist I’d revered and loved so much - gone. It took a few years before I came to terms with it although to some degree, it’ll always take me aback.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you, Michael Jackson.

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 12 things I've picked up over that period.",[947,281],["Date","2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/posts/first-year-professional-seo/)).\n\nHere is what I've learnt in my second year as a professional.\n\n## People\n\n### 1. Women in SEO are still the best\n\nThis hasn't changed from last year.\n\nThe women in our industry continue to make me think and push the boundaries even further. Within a couple of weeks at my new job, I was inspired to do things by a female colleague I wouldn't have thought of doing before and I felt better for it.\n\nGet more women of colour in every level of your business, make the working environment safe for them, and promote them.\n\n### 2. Experts still aren't experts\n\nAnother reiteration from last year. Expertise is a spectrum and nobody is at either end.\n\nI hope one day we can break the celebrity culture that surrounds experts and just let people learn and educate without the pedestals.\n\n### 3. You can't rely on others to make changes in diversity\n\nThe death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests sparked a lot of statements from people and agencies in the marketing industry. Hundreds of people suddenly started following me, contacting me, apologising, DMing me. It was a lot. And then it all died. People started unfollowing, talked to me less, stopped talking about racial diversity.\n\nIt left a bitter taste in my mouth because I never asked for any of it. Nobody did. But it reminded me of something. You can't rely on others to make changes like that, especially when they won't face their internal situations.\n\nAnd that's partly why I started my Marketers of Colour project. I needed to take charge of the situation and promote those people and their resources. That's my sole focus right now.\n\n### 4. John Mueller is even more awesome\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\n\n## Keywords\n\n### 5. It's still about topics\n\nI've been using my SERP scraper/NLP analyser script well over a year now and I've seen a lot of success and great feedback from it. The reason it works so well is it combines the power of keywords and headings to form ideas for topical content. What should you cover when you target a keyword? Then think of that keyword as a topic. You don't copy your competition, you \"listen\" to the crowd, cover the basics, and find the gaps to fill in their work.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 6. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but I like my spread of expertise\n\nWhen I started at Impression, most people asked if technical SEO was my strong suit and it is, even if I'm more of a \"jack of all trades\" in SEO (and that's not a criticism in this game!)\n\nI hope to get more into the technical side now I have colleagues that will help me. It's where I want to be.\n\n### 7. Python is still amazing but I need to get back into it.\n\n2020 being 2020, I didn't do much with Python besides using the scripts I'd already written. But I need to get back into it\n\n### 8. I love Ahrefs\n\nI wanted to use it for the longest time and then I gave up with it and now I have access and it's so cool and I prefer it to Semrush even though I have more experience with the latter and this sentence has gone on for long enough but you get the idea.\n\n### 9. I need to finally use a new API for a project\n\nI still think about APIs and I have a list of them I want to use but I haven't done it yet. Now it needs to happen. Maybe the PokéAPI. Something with natures. I don't know. Help!\n\n## Content and Links\n\n### 10. I want to get better at link building\n\nI remember my colleague had asked if I wanted to come over to the \"dark side\" aka digital PR and while I'll never join them (Star Wars reference, not being rude), I do feel like getting better at link building will be helpful to my colleagues and for me as an SEO and blogger. I just hate writing the emails to ask for links because I hate rejection.\n\n## Misc\n\n### 11. You shouldn't \"live and breathe marketing\"\n\nWhen you need guidance and direction and you ask for some, you hope to get it. Being told that responsibility lies with you and you need to \"live and breathe\" what you do isn't it. The only things you should be living and breathing are life and oxygen. Marketing, in the grander scheme of things, isn't so important that it has to consume your existence.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've become absorbed in work after hours because it was interesting or I wanted to finish it. But that isn't and shouldn't be the norm. We have colleagues and higher-ups to help (or we should). I'm glad my professional situation is much better and I have the help and support I always needed. There'll always be an element of stress to our work but it shouldn't be the only thing we face.\n\n### 12. I love writing for the Small Web\n\nA few weeks ago, I realised I was a Commercial Web marketer by day and a Small Web Blogger by night. The former pays me to live, the latter keeps me up late and excites me. They're at odds with each other because the Commercial Web pushes down Small Web content.\n\nOh, I haven't explained what they are. Briefly:\n\n- Commercial Web = the stuff associated with and optimised for _conversions_, _landing pages_, _sales funnels_, and _ROI_.\n- Small Web = the old days of [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) where you wrote about stuff that wasn't for SEO, posted links with no other content\n\nUnless you have a strong following on social media or have a large and engaging email list, your primary source of traffic will be organic and unoptimised content won't rank as highly. It's that simple. I relinquished that control last year and decided to write exactly what I wanted without focusing _too_ much on SEO. In some cases, I don't care about it at all. And it was liberating. And I _still_ got traffic.\n\nWhen people ask me what advice I'd give to people coming into digital marketing, I always say \"get a blog\". Make a space for yourself on the Web, test stuff, and see what works. Blogging is cool when you relax and let the words flow.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to:\n\n- Ruth Everett\n- Ronke Lawal\n- Rejoice Ojiaku\n- Sophie Logan\n- Surena Chande\n- Saffron Shergill\n- Azeem Ahmad\n- Tom Mortimer\n- Areej AbuAli\n- Tatiana Mac\n- Jamar Ramos\n- Olivia-Mae Foong\n- Lucy Robinson\n- Natalie Arney\n- Petar Jovetic\n- Dan Taylor\n\nAnd loads of other people I've not mentioned who have made my second year as an SEO a great one.","src/content/posts/second-year-professional-seo.md","47cddf69c7065bf7",{"html":5523,"metadata":5524},"\u003Cp>Today marks the second anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer (\u003Ca href=\"/posts/first-year-professional-seo/\">read about my first year here\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here is what I’ve learnt in my second year as a professional.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"people\">People\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-women-in-seo-are-still-the-best\">1.

They have some cool SEO behind them.",[507,947,4778],["Date","2023-08-11T23:00:00.000Z"],"Something I've been doing recently is looking for Pokémon nickname ideas. I'll search \"Pokémon + nickname\" and the site I always go to, regardless of rank, is PKMN.NET. They have a section called The Name Rater where people submit their nicknames and the name rater rates them with a healthy dose of snark and cynicism. The [kayfabe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe) was real!\n\n[PKMN.NET](https://pkmn.net/) is a UK Pokémon fan website and forum, founded by Psythor (James O'Malley), which officially opened on 10th January 2000. And It does remarkably well for these \"Pokémon + nickname\" queries. You'll often find them ranking in second place which is great going but the remarkable part is that the pages aren't optimised.\n\nHere's the metadata for [Blastoise's Name Rater page](https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&page=pokemon&id=9):\n\n* Meta title: Name Raters :: PKMN.NET\n* Meta description: PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting\n* URL: `https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&page=pokemon&id=9`\n* H1: N/A (in fact, there are no headings on this page)\n\nIf you're an SEO reading this, you might be having heart palpitations right now and I totally understand if you need to stop reading to get some fresh air and calm your nerves. How could they not have optimised metadata? And that URL! And no headings???\n\nBut read that meta description again:\n\n> PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting\n\nThanks to [a recent interview with The Johto Times](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-33), the accolade of being \"one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites\" is true. Those nickname submissions also date as far back as 2007. Sites like this would have had a lot of traffic back then and while it might have decreased, they'll maintain a steady stream today. I did a rough [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) search of over 400 \"Pokémon + nicknames\" queries (e.g. `fuecoco nicknames`) and found average monthly search volumes of up to 900 and total of 29,000. If you're ranking #2-#10 for something as niche as Pokémon nicknames without any optimisation, you're doing really well.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other factors contributing to this and the main one is probably links. Another check on Ahrefs showed:\n\n* 26,000 ranking keywords for the pkmn.net domain\n* Over 45,000 backlinks\n* 712 referring domains, of which 449 had follow links\n* The domains with the highest DRs were wikihow.com, neocities.org, adblockplus.org, and tvtropes.org\n\nYep, that'll do it. They're serving the user what they need (Pokémon nicknames), adding something unique (a snarky persona), it's _technically_ user-generated content, and they have a healthy link profile. And all without targeted metadata and headings.\n\nSo what's my point? Well, the reason I'm writing this besides my love of Pokémon and my habit of looking at websites from an SEO perspective outside work hours is because of CNET. You might have seen [their recent announcement about content pruning](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-cnet-content-pruning-plans-35876.html) to try and improve their search vsibility and traffic.

I felt that deleting archival content was a bad thing for those looking to the past for context and general discovery. Yes, information about AOL in 1996 isn't relevant to today's technology we can't just delete historical data because it doesn't suit us in the present. What's more, CNET are publishing AI-generated content, likely at scale, which will fill the gap and arguably muddy the waters of their site quality.\n\nGoing back to PKNN.NET, I think their site is an example of keeping something outdated in modern Web/search standards and it paying off in terms of organic performance. I'm sure it _could_ be better but it's not terrible right now.

I’ll search “Pokémon + nickname” and the site I always go to, regardless of rank, is PKMN.NET. They have a section called The Name Rater where people submit their nicknames and the name rater rates them with a healthy dose of snark and cynicism. The \u003Ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe\">kayfabe\u003C/a> was real!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://pkmn.net/\">PKMN.NET\u003C/a> is a UK Pokémon fan website and forum, founded by Psythor (James O’Malley), which officially opened on 10th January 2000. And It does remarkably well for these “Pokémon + nickname” queries. You’ll often find them ranking in second place which is great going but the remarkable part is that the pages aren’t optimised.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here’s the metadata for \u003Ca href=\"https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&#x26;page=pokemon&#x26;id=9\">Blastoise’s Name Rater page\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Meta title: Name Raters :: PKMN.NET\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Meta description: PKMN.NET is one of the largest Europe-based pokemon sites filled with not only plain information, but also other features to make life online that bit more interesting\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>URL: \u003Ccode>https://pkmn.net/?action=rater&#x26;page=pokemon&#x26;id=9\u003C/code>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>H1: N/A (in fact, there are no headings on this page)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>If you’re an SEO reading this, you might be having heart palpitations right now and I totally understand if you need to stop reading to get some fresh air and calm your nerves.

Those nickname submissions also date as far back as 2007. Sites like this would have had a lot of traffic back then and while it might have decreased, they’ll maintain a steady stream today. I did a rough \u003Ca href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs\u003C/a> search of over 400 “Pokémon + nicknames” queries (e.g. \u003Ccode>fuecoco nicknames\u003C/code>) and found average monthly search volumes of up to 900 and total of 29,000. If you’re ranking #2-#10 for something as niche as Pokémon nicknames without any optimisation, you’re doing really well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course, there are plenty of other factors contributing to this and the main one is probably links. Another check on Ahrefs showed:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>26,000 ranking keywords for the pkmn.net domain\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Over 45,000 backlinks\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>712 referring domains, of which 449 had follow links\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The domains with the highest DRs were wikihow.com, neocities.org, adblockplus.org, and tvtropes.org\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Yep, that’ll do it. They’re serving the user what they need (Pokémon nicknames), adding something unique (a snarky persona), it’s \u003Cem>technically\u003C/em> user-generated content, and they have a healthy link profile.

Kottke.org's old Quick Links heavily inspired me there and it meant I didn't have to feel overwhelmed by the idea of embellishing an idea when I didn't have much to say about it.\n\nBut as we see a lot of editorial sites getting shut down or transforming into \"SEO content\"\u003Ca href=\"#ibn-1\">\u003Csup>[1]\u003C/sup>\u003C/a> farms, newer fan-backed sites are popping up. Aftermath is one of the most popular ones right now (and I am a paying subscriber) with some great pieces on all kinds of topics; poignant and silly, current affairs and throwbacks to the past. It's been refreshing to read and I've been inspired to write more personal pieces on Distant Arcade because of them.\n\n## Guilty writing?\n\nThere is a downside though. So many long form pieces make me feel guilty for writing short blogs. Are they undercooked? Could I take more time with them and make them \"better\"? The guilt grows more as I get inundated with article ideas and don't have the time to put proverbial pen to paper.\n\nOf course, this is all silly because guess what? I'm not paid for any of this (at least not directly)\u003Ca href=\"#ibn-1\">\u003Csup>[2]\u003C/sup>\u003C/a> and writing is a pastime. Nobody is expecting me to write anything at any time unless I've told them I would. My blogs could go down and nobody close to me would notice. That sounds sad but it's okay. I write because I like to share and people still find my blogs via organic search which is remarkable to me since I don't optimise at all (I don't like to take _too_ much of my work home with me!)\n\n## Shortform king\n\nAnd that brings me back to the short form and why it might actually be a good thing. There's a concept called small-b blogging where personal blogs take centre stage. They're free of corporate nonsense and incorporate things like digital gardens and wikis. I feel like they can get a bit too meta and academic at times when you read the discourse around them but they are fundamentally different to a lot of blogs we see nowadays.\n\nThe shorter blogs add an element of subversion in that they go against the idea that longer is somehow better. There's no evidence to suggest longer is better from a ranking perspective but the idea is that if it's longer, you'll have (hopefully) fleshed out your thoughts. But maybe a quick thought is better than an embellished one. I have something to say, I say it, I publish, I move on. When a guide is necessary, I'll write one. Otherwise, here are some quips—enjoy!\n\n## Less is less\n\nAnother reason why I think shorter blogs are subversive is thrive on something that we take for granted: brevity. Everything we're exposed to has some kind of extravagance or maximalism. I think there's room for both in our lives, without question, but for _everything_? It's too much. So something quick to read that takes you somewhere, be it with a link or a lingering thought, might be enough. And enough is an underrated idea in life.\n\nI don't know who needs to hear this (besides me) but if you want to write something in 100 words or less and don't want to put it on your social media app of choice, throw it on your blog. And don't worry if nobody reads it. A written article has more chance of a reader than an unwritten one.\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n\t\u003Csup id=\"ibn-1\">1\u003C/sup>Yes, I said \"SEO content\" which may piss off some SEO professionals who think it's a misnomer of some kind but you all know what I mean and what its alleged purpose is.\n\n\t\u003Csup id=\"ibn-2\">2\u003C/sup>I have a Patreon which pays towards web hosting for my blogs and some tier rewards offer the chance to dictate what I write.

The header nav is smaller and more spread out\n\nI was heavily inspired by https://anhvn.com/ ([who I posted in my last blog](/posts/i-also-love-my-website/)) and how she had a thinner header strip. It just looks neater. With making it smaller, I've had to take out some of the links I didn't feel were worthy of a prominent place on every page on the site. That may change but for now, this is who it'll look.\n\n### 2. I've replaced Arial Black with Erode as the headings font\n\nIf you remember, I used to have two custom fonts for my main body and heading fonts but I thought it was silly to have the biggest files on my site in terms of size as fonts when the site was mostly text. It wasn't dragging UX performance down significantly but I wanted a site that could be loaded as fast as possible on all connections.\n\nThen I got bored of Arial Black.\n\nSo I took inspiration from Anh again and, rather than use Tiempos Text as well (1. I can't justify buying it and 2. I don't want to _copy_.), I went to look for a free serif font with some sophistication. And that's when I found Erode. Luckily, its file size is small (about 23KB or something) and my Lighthouse scores are still all 100s (I know, I know, they don't mean anything but without the traffic, I can't use field data and I like round figures, okay?!)\n\nI think it looks great and I'm happy with my choice.\n\n### 3. Wiki is now \"Jardim\" and Wikinotes are now \"Recortes\"\n\nOkay, so I'm not Portuguese but I've been learning the language since 2017 and visited Lisbon 3 times (and I'm going again next month). Besides Duolingo, I have no means of practice when I'm not there so I felt a good way to break out of the app would be to add some of that \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">sabor português\u003C/span> into my website.\n\nI realised that \"wiki\" wasn't working as a name for that area of my site and I was getting impressions for [KEYWORD + wiki] search terms which I didn't want.

That meant wikinotes had to go and, in keeping with the theme, I went with \u003Cspan lang=\"pt\">recortes\u003C/span>, which means \"cuttings\" in English. Like leaf cuttings or newspaper cuttings? \u003Cspan lang=\"fr\">Double entendre!\u003C/span> This post is suddenly getting very multilingual.\n\n### 4. I've started using Content Collections\n\nOne of the biggest issues with my site before was how content and dynamic pagination worked. I had to have folders in separate places with slightly different names that didn't work.\n\nAn example was all the blog posts had a URL slug of `/post/` rather than `/posts/`, the latter of which was only used for the index. Then, things like Release Notes and Morsels were housed under `/post/` and they were their own thing.\n\nI use Astro as my site framework and their Content Collections API has been around for a while. But I was wary of having to refactor my entire site and risk the loss of organic traffic (of what little traffic I get) but you know what? Screw it. I got sick of struggling and having messy code and folders so I did it over the course of two days. It wasn't easy but I figured stuff out and got it working. Then I fixed the broken links and set up redirects in the .htaccess file. And now things are better. So blog posts and the index are all under `/posts/`.\n\n### 5. Tags are gone\n\nThey were a workaround and weren't great so nothing lost really, other than some internal linking. But there are better ways to do that, once I figure them out.

And it's shorter. Short and unsweetened.\n\n## 1. I'm more bored of AI than last year\n\nA big one straight out of the gate. I started getting into AI a few years ago. I found it fascinating how you could take a dataset and train a model with it to create something personalised for all kinds of tasks. Generative AI seemed cool and new and shiny at the start but as time has gone on and with the widespread issues that this tech has, I've not only lost interest in a general sense but I've also grown bored of it.\n\nCompanies keep giving big tech corps money and brute forcing the technology into their services where it doesn't belong. Chatbots are fallible, prone to confabulations, could be harmful in so many ways, their underlying tech is bad for the environment. The list goes on. I', happy to give professional opinions on AI when asked as that's my job but my personal interest has diminished significantly. My only interest lies in NLP and specific machine learning techniques like embeddings and how they can be used for certain tasks. I still love using [RALTS](/posts/introducing-ralts/) and I actually use a local LLM from time to time when I want to do lower-level things like emails when I'm anxious and can't think of the words to say or nickname ideas for Pokémon and I don't use any of the outputs verbatim (see: [AI as a tool to lower the inertia of getting started](/posts/ai-lower-inertia-getting-started/))\n\n## 2. I'm still learning and relearning technical SEO and its importance\n\nIt's been 3.5 years since I officially became a technical SEO and despite being a senior now, I'm still learning and relearning about the discipline. One of the biggest lessons I've learnt over time is that not everything in tech is \"important\" based on certain criteria. Does a small site need to prioritise tech health? Not really, but it might if the foundations are shaky or there are early plans to expand. Big sites definitely need to keep on top of it but they often come with 6–12 month turnaround times for (relatively) small changes and you have to figure out a way to demonstrate importance with or without a business case.\n\nAudits aren't just checklists of any and every issue found in an auditing tool. This isn't new information and, in fact, a lot of tech SEOs will tell you this (if they haven't already written a blog post about it on their websites). Sometimes, a site just doesn't need a tech view and that should be okay to say. It's all about showing what will make a difference and how, if any. Then you have to try and measure it as best you can which comes with its own issues. A lot of common fixes won't affect ranking but may affect visibility but content and links affect both. How can you show your technical work did something when there are other contributing factors with unknown weights behind them all? Are there conclusive tests for this with strong methodologies? These are the questions I've tried to explore this year when I've had the time. \n\n## 3. I still love web performance and I still think it's more a CRO/UX thing than an SEO thing\n\nWhile I'm still doing plenty of Core Web Vitals audits and pushing back where site speed isn't a priority, I have started advocating for more involvement with CRO because web performance affects user experience and sessions more than visibility and ranking. I've yet to see enough convincing arguments to the contrary so the shift makes sense to me. Plus, it's easier to measure using UX metrics. Web performance doesn't do the heavy lifting when it comes to the SERP to site journey but it does in the site to conversion journey and that should be the focus.\n\n## 4. But reading about SEO or web performance outside of work hours gives me anxiety\n\nThis is a weird one but it's real. For some reason, whenever I see stuff about SEO outside of work, I get really anxious. I think it reminds me of how I feel like I'm \"behind\" everyone else because I'm not front and centre with my opinions or reading everything about everything. It's a very opinionated and expert-y space and I hate that a lot. If all that hot air was used to demystify the industry and make everything more accessible, that'd be fine. But it's still so snarky and corporate and I have no time for it. So I try to focus on what I think matters and filter everything else out.\n\n## 5. I don't feel like I'm doing meaningful work\n\nAnd the biggest one for last. [I wrote about this a few weeks ago](/posts/am-i-helping-or-harming/) but I don't feel like I'm making as positive a difference to the world as I'd like. I can't ignore what's happening out there right now and while SEO isn't there to change that (at least on its own), I don't always see the real changes I make for whoever I make them for. I'm not an expert or some kind of figurehead for anything so I won't know if I've inspired anyone from a professional perspective. So the disillusionment grows. Still got some thinking to do there.\n\n## Shout outs\n\nThank you to anyone who has helped me on my journey this year.

If they're not being thrusted into sprints and advocating for 10X engineering (I still don't get this), they're competing with AI that will either take their jobs or become an unwanted intern that they MUST use or... have AI take their jobs anyway. But as a technical SEO, it's frustrating to be tasked to assess web performance and present findings, fixes, and the importance of implementation and get told it's a low priority, it's a third-party issue, or not hear anything at all and not have anything fixed.\n\n## Core Web Vital relationships\n\nI've written about how web performance and improving Core Web Vitals metrics does not mean your site's rankings will improve directly and that these considerations are more about UX and session quality than ranking and visibility. Given that web development contributes a lot to the former, it's in everyone's interest to work on it.\n\nFor developers/agencies that monitor RUM data and action things, I salute you. I also understand that you need buy in to get this done because it costs more and adds further work on top of other things. But slower sites lose revenue so if we emphasise that, that has to bump up its importance even a little, right?\n\n## Guiding lights\n\nThere are so many guides telling us how to measure and fix LCP, CLS, and INP issues alongside case studies\u003Ca href=\"#in-1\">\u003Csup>[1]\u003C/sup>\u003C/a> and experiments for every framework and CMS you can think of. But the guide-to-action ratio is too high on the guide side. We need the fixes put in or to be told why they can't more often.\n\n* If it's a low priority, what can we do to make it a higher priority?\n* If it's a third-party issue, has that been tested? Is there an opportunity to liase with that third party to find a fix? Or maybe a short term fix on the front/back end if it's deemed worth it?\n* If there's radio silence, can we establish a regular form of contact just to hear if it's being worked on or on hold and when to check back?\n\n## What you saying, devs?\n\nLooking at these, this is more of a \"me\" problem and not establishing these processes. But for a SEO-client-dev relationship to work, it has to be on an equal footing. As well as an abundance of how-to guides for web performance, there are a lot of \"how SEO can work with devs\" guides as well but very few going in the opposite direction. I'd love to hear more from devs on what they might need from us.\n\n## Reputation management\n\nSEO has a bad reputation amongst anyone who isn't an SEO thanks to mass proliferation by content site owners, Google, and \"SEO guru\" culture. I know there'll be plenty of web devs who see SEO in those kinds of lights and treat it accordingly. Sadly, I don't see a lot of damage control on that front but perhaps if we talked it out Red Table Talk style or battled in the ring like Celebrity Deathmatch\u003Ca href=\"#in-2\">\u003Csup>[2]\u003C/sup>\u003C/a> (showing my age there). This isn't me trying to be a liberal, I just want to feel some worth in my work and maybe mend some bridges so it doesn't feel like a stuggle when raising tickets or making recommendations.\n\nIf you're a web dev and none of this has offended you, feel free to email me with any of your thoughts or comments and I'd be happy to talk.\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n\t\u003Cp>\u003Csup id=\"in-1\">1\u003C/sup> I really wish people would show more methodologies and confidence levels in their case studies.

You can automate a lot of things but because no two sites are ever truly the same, you, the SEO, need to pick out what really matters and what doesn't. For me, it's better if a human does it compared to a catch-all solution or a machine learning tool.\n\nOne thing that I've grown accustomed to is assessing the use and unintentional misuse of robots.txt. If you don't know, robots.txt is a text file that contains instructions that a search engine bot should follow when crawling a site. The most common directives relate to what pages a crawler can and can't crawl, using the keywords `allow` and `disallow`.\n\nHere's what mine looks like:\n\n```\nUser-agent: *\nAllow: /\n\nUser-Agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-Agent: GPTBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Google-Extended\nDisallow: /\n\nSitemap: https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/sitemap.xml\n```\n\nThis says that any crawler can crawl the site... except ChatGPT-User, GPTBot, and Google-Extended (which are all AI crawlers, although given their current practices for scraping, these might be redundant).\n\nOn e-commerce sites, you'll see a lot of URL path types blocked from crawls such as search pages (e.g. **example.org/search/blah+blah+blah**) and filter parameter pages (e.g. **example.org/?filter=colour&size=large**). But, for Google, this isn't always the best way. [In their documentation on robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro), they say:\n\n>  A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.\n\nThat's arguably the most important point of the documentation. Robots.txt is there to stop your servers from getting overloaded by crawl requests through carefully selected directives. That's where the efficiency lies. But blocking pages from being crawled won't block it from getting into the index, and a lot of sites (often by default) have directives that disallow common page types as described above.\n\nNow, Googlebot often follows this correctly and they will get blocked and therefore won't get indexed but it's not guaranteed to stay that way, especially if you happen to link to those blocked pages anywhere else, and in abundance. I've come across sites that link to blocked filter pages _at scale_ and since links are heavily weighted Google's search algorithms, they see this as a strong signal for indexation. The result: blocked pages get indexed. This isn't inherently a bad thing for search as these pages aren't optimised and won't take up much if any visiblity for a site for important keywords... but they could, and if you've used a technique for one thing, you don't want it to be ignored or mess up your overall strategy.\n\nSo what do you do in these situations? Drum roll please...\n\n🥁 🥁 🥁\n\n...IT DEPENDS! 🎉 🍾\n\nBut seriously, as Google said, if you don't want a page to be indexed, use noindex. Robots.txt wasn't designed for noindexation so don't use it for that. The reason why so many frameworks and platforms block certain page types like search and filters is often sites have thousands of pages and you'll want a crawler to focus on product and category pages over things like in-site search. In fact, these pages are often canonicalised or noindexed anyway in which case blocking them via robots.txt could actually be a problem anyway (it might not see the noindex or canonical if it's blocked).\n\nSo, to sum up: \n\n* If you want to stop Googlebot from pressuring your servers with crawl requests (based on evidence that Googlebot is doing this in the first place), add a disallow directive.\n* If you have a smaller site* and just don't want pages to be indexed, add a noindex tag and don't sweat the technique. I mean, crawling of those pages.\n\nCrawl effiency isn't a concern for a small site as Googlebot can handle this without issue.

Here's why nuance is needed when talking about its relationship with SEO",[947,281,422,1177],["Date","2023-07-01T23:00:00.000Z"],"As a technical SEO, I am very passionate about web performance. The speed and overall performance of a page can affect how well a search engine crawler can crawl and index a page (amongst many other factors). The usual way to define that is through metrics like Google's [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals/), which form part of their [Page Experience ranking signal](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience)\u003Csup>\u003Ca href =\"#sidenote\">\\*\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>. But there's a problem I've noticed between both SEO and web performance communities: people are giving too much weight to Core Web Vitals from a ranking perspective.\n\nNow, I'm going to use an example from [Speedcurve](https://www.speedcurve.com/) to illustrate this. I don't think the information on their [SEO and Web Performance](https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/seo-web-performance/) is terrible or incorrect but I feel like some caveats are important to avoid misunderstandings or heated debates between businesses and their in-house SEOs/agencies.\n\nIn the section titled “How much does web performance matter when it comes to SEO?”, they say the following:\n\n>Since Web Vitals were announced, they've shot to the top of many people's list of things to care about. But Google's prioritization of page speed in search ranking isn't new, even for mobile. As far back as 2013, Google announced that pages that load slowly on mobile devices would be penalized in mobile search.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>Performance has had an impact on SEO long before Web Vitals came along. Back in 2011, Smartfurniture.com [shared](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/the-growing-need-for-speed-how-site-performance-increasingly-influences-search-rankings):\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>\"We discovered we could make a quantum leap in search engine rankings simply by increasing site performance. Across the board, we’ve seen sales increases because of our improved ranking, with 20% more organic traffic being driven to our site and 14% more page views.\"\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n>More recently, Pinterest [shared](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7#.wwimdmkpp) that rebuilding their site with performance in mind resulted in a 15% increase in organic search traffic. (You can find more SEO-related case studies at [WPOstats.com](https://wpostats.com/tags/seo/).)\n\n## What the Speed Update really meant\n\nThe first flag for me was regarding Google's penalisation of slow sites in mobile search. There was an [announcement in 2018 in a Google blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search) but \"penalised\" is a problematic word to use in this context (and **many** news sites ran with it at the time). The reason for that is because Google has a [manual penalty system](https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509) for serious cases such as black hat tactics such as keyword cloaking, keyword stuffing, [private blog networks (or PBNs)](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/private-blog-network), and misleading redirects.\n\nIf you get caught, Google \"penalises\" you by dropping your rank or deindexing completely. Most people are aware of these kinds of penalties so using that terminology to describe the effects of having a slow site can give the wrong connotations. So to be clear and diligent, a slow site will not tank your rankings directly. Sites that have issues that don't allow them to be crawled and indexed correctly will see rankings fall and slow speeds could be associative in those cases but not the primary or sole cause. _Hope that makes sense; let me know if not! x_\n\nAn important paragraph from the 2018 blog post is this:\n\n> The \"Speed Update\", as we're calling it, will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.\n\nSo this isn't necessarily sitewide, it only affects a small portion of queries, and a slow page might not see a change in rank because of its content relevance. And that's how seach should work. The biggest sites in terms of indexed pages and popularity are in the vast minority on the Web. A lot of them are also memory, storage, data, and time hogs. You don't see them falling down the rankings or out of them completely so perhaps speed isn't _that_ big a deal compared to other signals like content relevance, link profiles, and efficient crawling and indexation.\n\n## Web performance doesn't always correlate with organic ranking\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"float-img-right\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/i-make-lots-of-graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Simpson holding up a graph with the caption 'I make a lot of graphs'\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" />\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Lisa is clearly an SEO.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nA few studies were quoted in the referenced Speedcurve paragraph, from Smartfurniture.com and Pinterest.

But it is so difficult to attribute web performance changes in SEO without taking other factors into account. You often see percentages and monetary figures but rarely what happened to get to those stages. And then there are the confusions between users engaging with SERPs (search engine results pages) and users engaging with the site once they click the SERP listing link.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, a slow page may still rank highly so you can't attribute performance improvements to improved impressions or clicks. Factors like [seasonality](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seasonal-seo-tips/438300/), competitors, updates, content relevance, and link profiles make a bigger difference on that front. Once you're on the page, then speed can become a factor. But what happens if you make content changes at the same time? Or change the links on the page? Which one made the most difference? It's hard to say for sure.\n\nThat's not to say I doubt that improving web performance makes a difference to conversions and general organic performance but it requires a methodology and careful analysis to attribute the changes to the right places.\n\n## Who Core Web Vitals is really for\n\nThe section titled “Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?” examines metrics to look out for when measuring performance and where you can improve. There are four listed:\n\n* [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp)\n* [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/articles/fid)\n* [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp/)\n* [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls)\n\nLCP, FID, and CLS are currently the Core Web Vitals metrics, while [INP will replace FID in March 2024](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv). As Google created these as best measures for web performance (in their eyes, and they know they aren't perfect), I agree these should be metrics to focus on. But my issue is with the title:\n\n**Which performance metrics should you focus on for SEO?**\n\nThe question should be:\n\n**Which performance metrics should you focus on for \u003Cspan style=\"color:#FC1420;\">_users_\u003C/span>?**\n\nOf course, I get that this whole page is about SEO and web performance but users are the common denominator at every stage of the journey. A site can rank #1 for a term and very few people click on the link in the SERPs ([thanks, Google Ads!](https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-are-dark-patterns/)).\n\nIf they do though, they navigate the site, may convert, may not, may abandon their cart, may not, may leave, may come back, may not. All of that may be because of site speed or visual shifts. Or it could be people being indecisive or wanting to save money. UX plays a crucial part in all of that, which is why Core Web Vitals and web performance shouldn't be so tightly bound with SEO; it should be connected with UX in a cute [Ring a Ring o' Roses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeMcG5OT5BU)-type relationship. Oh, and devs too. They can join in...

I feel like a broken record for saying this (at least in my head) but improving CWV metrics won't boost organic rankings without a lot of caveats but it most certainly will improve organic session quality, leading to better session duration, conversions, and revenue.\n\nUsers don't know how slow your site is in the SERPs but they'll find out once they click the link so prepare for that part and let helpful content, link building, and EEAT do the preliminary work.\n\nThis is the kind of message we need to send to clients and our peers when discussing why CWV is important. We need to be specific or we're gonna look like snake oil merchants (oh wait, we already do: look at SEO's reputation with devs and the media \\*side-eyes The Verge\\*)\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to pick on Speedcurve or suggesting they suck or they're telling lies (I actually like their product and the people I know of that work there as they do really awesome work in the web performance sector so thank you!) My overrarching point is this: when we talk about SEO and web performance, we need to refrain from saying things like \"improving site speed is a ranking factor and doing so will improve your SEO ranking\". Those kinds of statements are either not true or barely true or only giving a small portion of the information needed to be true.\n\nThe real truth is that Page Experience is just one signal amongst many others and within Page Experience, Core Web Vitals is one part of many. That means it's not heavily weighted and people (who know that) should be saying it. At the moment, I fear that people thinking there's an equal weight to content, links, and page speed when that just isn't the case. Where page speed _is_ heavily weighted is in direct user experiences and people's abilities to navigate websites in a way that makes them stay, return, and feel comfortable to do both. If it's a commercial site, they're more likely to buy stuff or sign up to stuff. If it's informational, they're more likely to read and comment.\n\nPeople will always click links on SERPs. They might not always stay on your site for long. Web performance is therefore more important for the latter than the former and SEO, UX, dev work, and higher-ups buy-in should work together to make that all happen and make everyone happy. Or happier at least.\n\n\u003Cp id=\"sidenote\">\u003Csmall>\u003Cem>*Please note: Page Experience is *not* a ranking system and Google has said that before and I don't want to piss Danny Sullivan off any more than he likely seems to be when people misattribute his/Google's official documentation, even if it isn't always _that_ clear but I digress.\u003C/em>\u003C/small>\u003C/p>","src/content/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf.md","91f25e893aaedb07",{"html":5789,"metadata":5790},"\u003Cp>As a technical SEO, I am very passionate about web performance.

But Google’s prioritization of page speed in search ranking isn’t new, even for mobile. As far back as 2013, Google announced that pages that load slowly on mobile devices would be penalized in mobile search.\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\nPerformance has had an impact on SEO long before Web Vitals came along. Back in 2011, Smartfurniture.com \u003Ca href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/the-growing-need-for-speed-how-site-performance-increasingly-influences-search-rankings\">shared\u003C/a>:\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n“We discovered we could make a quantum leap in search engine rankings simply by increasing site performance.

There was an \u003Ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search\">announcement in 2018 in a Google blog post\u003C/a> but “penalised” is a problematic word to use in this context (and \u003Cstrong>many\u003C/strong> news sites ran with it at the time). The reason for that is because Google has a \u003Ca href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509\">manual penalty system\u003C/a> for serious cases such as black hat tactics such as keyword cloaking, keyword stuffing, \u003Ca href=\"https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/private-blog-network\">private blog networks (or PBNs)\u003C/a>, and misleading redirects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you get caught, Google “penalises” you by dropping your rank or deindexing completely. Most people are aware of these kinds of penalties so using that terminology to describe the effects of having a slow site can give the wrong connotations. So to be clear and diligent, a slow site will not tank your rankings directly. Sites that have issues that don’t allow them to be crawled and indexed correctly will see rankings fall and slow speeds could be associative in those cases but not the primary or sole cause. \u003Cem>Hope that makes sense; let me know if not! x\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An important paragraph from the 2018 blog post is this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The “Speed Update”, as we’re calling it, will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>So this isn’t necessarily sitewide, it only affects a small portion of queries, and a slow page might not see a change in rank because of its content relevance. And that’s how seach should work. The biggest sites in terms of indexed pages and popularity are in the vast minority on the Web. A lot of them are also memory, storage, data, and time hogs.

It's a phrase that started out as a way to describe a form of coding without thought, per [Andrej Karpathy's original tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383), which I'll quote here:\n\n> There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.\n\nIt might sound daunting to some and maybe even a little dangerous. You're laughing? You're trusting a large language model to code and debug and you're laughing? Then Simon Willson write about [what vibe coding is and isn't](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/) and [a subsequent Bluesky thread on his frustration at the term losing its intended meaning](https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3lkqracn2yk2m):\n\n> Feels like I'm losing the battle on this one, I keep seeing people use \"vibe coding\" to mean any time an LLM is used to write code\n\u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>\nI'm particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear, widely accepted definition!\n\n\u003Cfigure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/vibe-coding.jpg\" alt=\"a man sitting on a sofa, talking to a woman (out of shot) with the caption 'vibe coding'\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"166\" /> \u003Cimg src=\"/images/vibe-coding-2.jpg\" alt=\"a man sitting on a sofa, talking to a woman (out of shot) with the caption 'the word has lost all meaning'\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"166\" />\n\t\u003Cfigcaption>Jon Lovitz: the right man to distill this discourse\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI thought it was perhaps naive to think that a phrase or concept related to AI in these times would stay worthwhile and not get misinterpreted. After all, that's what LLMs themselves inherently do, right? I also felt like using the word \"vibe\" was like a backdoor for it as well. It was only a matter of time before it lost its way IMO.\n\n## Is vibe coding even new?\n\nThe reason why I started writing this is because I've seen a few examples of \"vibe coding\" from people in the tech industry that I respect, notably Vincent Warmerdam. He has dug a bit deeper into it beyond coding and leaving, with mini projects such as [this Santorini game made with CSS transitions](https://koaning.io/posts/study-those-claude-vibes/). His suggestion is to \"study the vibes\" and learn new things from what the LLMs propose in their code. And that got me thinking: isn't that how we learnt code when we were teenagers?\n\nI never got into the whole MySpace coding thing but I know plenty of my peers did and it was their gateway into HTML and CSS. If we wanna talk about vibes, they were _very_ high back then. The customisations were only limited to the creator's imagination (and the specs in the mid-2000s of course). People were coding stuff and making it work, whether it was a bit hacky or not reproducible (looking at you, `!important`)\n\nNow, vibe coding refers to LLM coding more specifically where you don't care as much about the output but perhaps its been repackaged from the past. How many of us were blindly copying code from other peoples' sites and putting them in our own? Did it work properly? Would they find out? Would I get caught? Who cares, it works well enough! And, let's face it, LLMs are doing the same thing but in a more \"sophisticated\" way (not gonna talk about that here so discuss that amongst yourselves).\n\nWhen I was learning how to code HTML and CSS, I didn't look up much if any documentation. There was no YouTube and I rarely had internet access. Just FrontPage Express and hopes and dreams. Having a WYSIWYG editor meant I didn't need to care about HTML or CSS _code_. The vibe was what I wanted out of my site, picking colours and fonts and using tables for layouts. Was I vibe coding back then? Was FrontPage Express taking care of the hard stuff so I didn't have to?\n\n## What's in a name?\n\nFirst, it was \"prompt engineering\" and now \"vibe coding\". Terms I've felt a little icky using but they're short and quippy and I guess explain what I'm doing, _kinda_? Prompt engineering still feels like hopping on one leg while asking the LLM to code what you want, thinking it's the hopping that really made it work. And vibe coding feels like a slight rehash of what we used to do with less accessibility to information, slower internet speeds, and a desire to make cool things using the tools we had.\n\nAnd none of this is to discredit anyone I've mentioned (although I worry that I have so apologies!). But I always think with the increased proliferation of these tools and ideologies that people can get swept up by them and not see history repeating itself or look for easier alternatives. Anything we create and share is immediately up for scrutiny or completely ignored in a sea of other projects, and that includes new buzzwords and the projects that come out of them. Hell, I'm scrutinising right now! At this point, whatever we create, we have to be prepared to set free and pick and choose what we claw back before nefarious people get their hands on it.\n\nSadly with vibe coding, it might have started out as a tongue-in-cheek thing, and almost throwaway but now it has taken on a life of its own and we're halfway between taking it seriously and poking fun.

It’s a phrase that started out as a way to describe a form of coding without thought, per \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\">Andrej Karpathy’s original tweet\u003C/a>, which I’ll quote here:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>It might sound daunting to some and maybe even a little dangerous. You’re laughing? You’re trusting a large language model to code and debug and you’re laughing?

After all, that’s what LLMs themselves inherently do, right? I also felt like using the word “vibe” was like a backdoor for it as well. It was only a matter of time before it lost its way IMO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"is-vibe-coding-even-new\">Is vibe coding even new?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The reason why I started writing this is because I’ve seen a few examples of “vibe coding” from people in the tech industry that I respect, notably Vincent Warmerdam. He has dug a bit deeper into it beyond coding and leaving, with mini projects such as \u003Ca href=\"https://koaning.io/posts/study-those-claude-vibes/\">this Santorini game made with CSS transitions\u003C/a>. His suggestion is to “study the vibes” and learn new things from what the LLMs propose in their code. And that got me thinking: isn’t that how we learnt code when we were teenagers?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I never got into the whole MySpace coding thing but I know plenty of my peers did and it was their gateway into HTML and CSS. If we wanna talk about vibes, they were \u003Cem>very\u003C/em> high back then. The customisations were only limited to the creator’s imagination (and the specs in the mid-2000s of course). People were coding stuff and making it work, whether it was a bit hacky or not reproducible (looking at you, \u003Ccode>!important\u003C/code>)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now, vibe coding refers to LLM coding more specifically where you don’t care as much about the output but perhaps its been repackaged from the past. How many of us were blindly copying code from other peoples’ sites and putting them in our own? Did it work properly? Would they find out? Would I get caught? Who cares, it works well enough! And, let’s face it, LLMs are doing the same thing but in a more “sophisticated” way (not gonna talk about that here so discuss that amongst yourselves).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I was learning how to code HTML and CSS, I didn’t look up much if any documentation. There was no YouTube and I rarely had internet access. Just FrontPage Express and hopes and dreams. Having a WYSIWYG editor meant I didn’t need to care about HTML or CSS \u003Cem>code\u003C/em>. The vibe was what I wanted out of my site, picking colours and fonts and using tables for layouts. Was I vibe coding back then? Was FrontPage Express taking care of the hard stuff so I didn’t have to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"whats-in-a-name\">What’s in a name?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>First, it was “prompt engineering” and now “vibe coding”. Terms I’ve felt a little icky using but they’re short and quippy and I guess explain what I’m doing, \u003Cem>kinda\u003C/em>? Prompt engineering still feels like hopping on one leg while asking the LLM to code what you want, thinking it’s the hopping that really made it work. And vibe coding feels like a slight rehash of what we used to do with less accessibility to information, slower internet speeds, and a desire to make cool things using the tools we had.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And none of this is to discredit anyone I’ve mentioned (although I worry that I have so apologies!). But I always think with the increased proliferation of these tools and ideologies that people can get swept up by them and not see history repeating itself or look for easier alternatives. Anything we create and share is immediately up for scrutiny or completely ignored in a sea of other projects, and that includes new buzzwords and the projects that come out of them. Hell, I’m scrutinising right now! At this point, whatever we create, we have to be prepared to set free and pick and choose what we claw back before nefarious people get their hands on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sadly with vibe coding, it might have started out as a tongue-in-cheek thing, and almost throwaway but now it has taken on a life of its own and we’re halfway between taking it seriously and poking fun.

So I logged off and I’ve not felt a great need to come back in the same way I had before. I don’t know whether I will. I almost don’t want to. I want to be able to talk, speak to only the people who talk to me, and leave. Lists serve that purpose but it’s whether I can be bothered to log in to make that work. We’ll see.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For now, I’m just blogging. I have a backlog of ideas to blog about and I’ve really got into it this weekend. Over the last week or so, I finally got into \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)\">Halt and Catch Fire\u003C/a>, a series that examined the computing boom of the 80s and the Internet Age of the 90s. The acting was superb and I particularly enjoyed the parts about the Internet, the Web, and search (as that’s my job and a great passion of mine). Then, I listened back to a podcast episode with my favourite blogger, \u003Ca href=\"https://kottke.org\">Jason Kottke\u003C/a>. I’d temporarily postponed him (not quite a cancellation) after a post that rubbed me up the wrong way but he put me onto Halt and Catch Fire (as he appeared in it for a brief scene) and I’ve modelled my blogging style on his over the last year or so.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And now I’m here. Turns out I did know what to talk about after all. As always, please check out the links below to my blogs and Patreon which financially supports them all. Maybe one day I can do this blogging thing full time as if it’s the 00s.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thanks and take care.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>—Luke\u003C/p>",{"headings":5902,"localImagePaths":5903,"remoteImagePaths":5904,"frontmatter":5905,"imagePaths":5908},[],[],[],{"title":5892,"description":5893,"published":38,"pubDate":5906,"tags":5907},"9 Aug 2020",[1156,63],[],"speeches-thanks.md","some-thoughts-seirdy-takeaways-google-leak",{"id":5910,"data":5912,"body":5917,"filePath":5918,"digest":5919,"rendered":5920,"legacyId":5939},{"title":5913,"description":5914,"published":38,"tags":5915,"pubDate":5916},"Some thoughts on Seirdy's takeaways from the Google content doc leak","Sorry, I couldn't think of a more SEO title for this, heh heh.",[947,281],["Date","2025-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"While looking through a webring that one of my other sites is on, I noticed Seirdy's name.

Sometimes it amazes me to know intuitively that the grieving are all around us yet we do not see any overt signs about grief that lingers. Like a stain on our clothes, it marks us as flawed, imperfect. To cling to grief, to desire its expression, is to be out of sync with modern life, where the hip do not get bogged down in mourning.\n\nIt reminded me—amongst all the reminders I've had since March 2020—that I've been in some state of grief every year for at least a decade. Before I used to think they were small and insignificant. Break ups are a natural part of life if you choose to love. Interview rejections are part and parcel of being a member of a capitalist society. Your idols die because everybody will some day. But if you don't deal with things, they accumulate and I am the product of that accumulation.\n\nI've never felt like I've had the \"luxury\" of grieving when I've had to carry on. Some days, you just want to curl in a ball and not leave that spot for days. I guess I have done that before. But the fear of being asked about it by loved ones often pulls me out. _Maybe it wasn't that bad then_. But it becomes grief deferred or sustained grief as bell hooks described it. And because of how society works, the solution is always a book or a chat or a change in diet or a walk.

Sometimes it amazes me to know intuitively that the grieving are all around us yet we do not see any overt signs about grief that lingers. Like a stain on our clothes, it marks us as flawed, imperfect.

So here it is.\n\n## Tools of the trade\nFor the flow to work, I need tools to help me and streamline the process. I'm prone to getting ideas and forgetting them so structure is essential for me.\n\nThe things I use are:\n\n* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)\n* Pocket (RIP 2007–2025)\n* [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/)\n* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/)\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)/~~[Grav](https://getgrav.org/)~~\n* [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)\n\nIn terms of cost: Pocket, Python (I use ~~[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)~~ [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as a virtual notebook environment), Wordpress ~~and Grav~~, and Twitter are free. Raindrop is free but I pay £3/month for extra features (not essential but I wanted to try them and I'll explain more about it later). Buffer is $10 for their Awesome Plan, which lets me send updates through 10 different social accounts. Pinboard costs $18 a year for a basic account.\n\nIn total, it costs me about £140 a year but you could easily do it for free if you followed my process and maybe replace Pinboard with Raindrop for general bookmarks or just keep them in your browser.\n\n## The process\nI run 5 main blogs (and this personal blog) mostly on my own and that means I can't update everything as regularly as I'd like. To avoid losing steam and ideas, I follow this process:\n\n1. I find interesting content on the Web, either on Twitter or Feedly\n2. If it piques my interest, it goes into my Pocket list for further evaluation (unless I read it there and then)\n3. If I want to write about it, I add it to one of my Raindrop folders (called Collections)\n4. If I don't want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard\n5. I use a special Python script to decide what to write about\n6. I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Grav for this site\n7. I use Buffer to schedule updates (or if I don't write about it, I just put the link on there)\n\n## The Python script\nIf you're not familiar with Python, you can skip this part as it's purely for my benefit. Otherwise, keep reading!\n\n[Raindrop has its own API](https://help.raindrop.io/collections/) which gives access to my account and all the bookmarks in my Collections. Here's the code:\n\n~~~\nimport requests\nimport random\n\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer AUTHORIZATION_CODE'}\n\nr = requests.get(\n'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections/childrens', headers=headers)\n\nresponse = r.json()\n\nraindrop_list = []\n\nfor num in range(0,len(response[\"items\"])):\n\tcount = response[\"items\"][num][\"count\"]\n\ttitle = response[\"items\"][num][\"title\"]\n\ttitle_count = (title, random.randint(0,count))\n\traindrop_list.append(title_count)\n\traindrop = [tuples for tuples in raindrop_list if tuples[1] != 0]\n\nrand = random.randint(0,len(raindrop_list)-1)\nprint(raindrop[rand])\n~~~\nI'll explain each line.\n\n`requests` gives me access to the API and `random` is for the random pick, which I'll explain in a second.\n\nI set the headers which contains my authorisation token and that is added to the Collections URL. I then convert the data into readable JSON so I can access the relevant keys and values.\n\n`raindrop_list` is an empty list which will be filled with tuples. Those tuples contain the name of the Collection and the number of bookmarks in them (eg. `('Food & Drink', 7)`)\n\nI create a for loop that goes through each Collection via a range. I store the count of each Collection in a variable called `count` and the title in `title`.\n\n`title_count` creates the tuple mentioned above but the number is a random integer between 0 and `count`.\n\nEach `title_count` gets added to `raindrop_list` and then I assign a new list comprehension to a variable called `raindrop` which gets rid of all the empty Collections.\n\nFinally, I create a random integer between 0 and `len(raindrop_list)-1` and use that as the random index of `raindrop` which gets printed out.\n\nMake sense? Probably not as that's the first time I've ever had to explain one of my scripts. In a nutshell, the script randomly selects a Collection and a bookmark from that Collection for me to write about. It keeps me fresh and I don't get bogged down in something I just saw. I also get rid of older content and it never gets stale.\n\nAs for the reason why I decided to pay for Raindrop - with the free version, you get root Collections only. With the paid version, you can nest Collections inside root Collections so I can segment by blog category.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis is a flow that works for me and I'm almost certain it won't work for anyone else. That's because I often write about random things I think are cool and I don't have clients or money invested in my content (excluding web hosting). So it could be cool to me but nobody read it. Fine for me, not for clients!\n\nBut the fundamental process is transferrable. You organise your data into certain places and dip in when you need to. And when you're done, you can delete them. I used to have a major problem of adding things to Pocket and they just... stayed there. Now, I actively go through them, and move them to better places if I keep them or delete them when I'm done.","src/content/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow.md","7cf849a274fbbd62",{"html":6205,"metadata":6206},"\u003Cp>A few months ago, I “revealed” my content creation flow on Twitter (as if it was a secret) and I said I’d write about it in more detail.

But what more have I learnt? I wrote a list of 12 things I've picked up over that period.",[947],["Date","2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Today marks the third anniversary of me becoming a digital marketer ([read about my first year here](/posts/first-year-professional-seo/) and [my second year here](/posts/second-year-professional-seo/)).\n\nHere is what I've learnt in my third year as a professional.\n\n## People\n\n### 1. Women in SEO are still the best\n\nThis still hasn't changed from last year or the year before.\n\nI'm especially grateful to all the women of colour in the industry continuously breaking boundaries and getting into spaces that are still reserved for white male colleagues or creating their own.\n\nAnd a special shout out to the likes of Miracle Inameti-Archibong, Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis of [B-DigitalUK](https://twitter.com/bdigital_uk), Sophie Logan, Carla Thomas, Amanda Jordan, Krystal Taing, Chima Mmeje, [Crystal Carter](https://www.crystalcarterseo.com/), Tasha Amponsah-Antwi, and so many more Black women I could name.\n\n### 2. SEOs really love experts, huh?\n\nTwo things. 1) I'm honoured to be considered a person of high expertise in an industry I only officially joined 3 years ago. 2) I'm not an expert. That's okay to say as it isn't a binary construct of \"OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\" on one end and \"I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER\" on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That's how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).\n\n### 3. Many at the top don't really want diversity, know what it is, or care if they do\n\nI'll be writing a follow-up to my piece on [Being Black in Digital Marketing](https://adzooma.com/blog/being-black-in-digital-marketing/), looking back at the last 2 years and analysing if anything has changed. While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I'm by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku & Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can't help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we're back where we were as a community. I'm neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I've had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don't really want diversity in SEO, don't know what it is, or care about it if understand it. I just wish those people would say it with their chests instead of hiding behind annual statements. The truth shall set you free!\n\n### 4. John Mueller has maintained his very high awesome level\n\nJohn, if you're reading this, I love you and I want to thank you for your patience, hard work, and spirit. Same as last year.\n\n## Technical\n\n### 5. Technical SEO is still my strong suit but NLP, AI, and machine learning are my next steps\n\nSince my last update, I was promoted to technical SEO specialist which was a career goal. I also mentioned how my expertise was still varied between content and technical. But my new favourite interest is [AI](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/ai/), particularly [machine learning](https://logicface.co.uk/category/tech/computing/computer-science/ai/machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/nlp/). I'm not as interested about the kind of AI you see in the general media (which people often confuse with [AGI or artifical general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and those involved do little to distinguish the perception) but specifically how we can use NLP to help SEO and the Web.\n\nI've also really got into ontologies and how they work so if search ontologist becomes a job, I'd love that one day. Manifesting!\n\n### 6. Python is still amazing and I'm getting back into it.\n\nI released my first proper Python project out in the open (not including the defunct [WatSERP script](https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/) that I will eventually reupload in the future). [Read more about RALTS in its dedicated blog post](/posts/introducing-ralts/).\n\n### 7. I love Google Search Console\n\nAfter three years of using Semrush and Ahrefs, my true love lies with Search Console. It's all about that granular data!\n\n### 8. I found a new API - thanks TextRazor!\n\nSince moving away from IBM Watson [for moral reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1939%E2%80%931945:_World_War_II), [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) has been my new favourite API. I love the entities and topics it can pull and how easy (for me) it was to get it all connected. There's plenty more in it that I could use and I look forward to digging deeper.\n\n## Content and Links\n\n### 9. I'm fine with not being good at link building\n\nLink building is for link builders and people who enjoy it. I'll stick with the technical stuff. Ha!\n\n## Misc\n\n### 10. You shouldn't \"live and breathe marketing\"\n\nThere's a lot of ego and posturing in SEO. People will say \"don't do this\" and \"you must do that\" in equal measure and amplitude. My advice? Learn to code if you want to. Don't if you don't. Ignore folks who tell you MUST do one or the other. Coding has variables for a reason.\n\n### 11. Outside of work, I'm a LESSEO\n\nI will write about this in more detail but I am a LESSEO outside of my daily work. LESSEO describes my approach to Web writing where I don't optimise my titles, might not even write a meta description, but I do take notice of entities and internal linking. My content isn't completely unoptimised but not to the point where I'm focusing on ranking.\n\nI chose this term over my old descriptor (anti-SEO) as it was more accurate.

That’s okay to say as it isn’t a binary construct of “OMG IMPOSTOR SYNDROME” on one end and “I AM AN INDUSTRY THOUGHT LEADER” on the other. We should perhaps move away from lists of chosen experts and more towards building open communities for industry members of all levels to learn, grow, and feel comfortable. Mentors are good but focusing on creating them over anything else is harmful. That’s how you end up with all-white (male) panels at conferences (still).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"3-many-at-the-top-dont-really-want-diversity-know-what-it-is-or-care-if-they-do\">3.

While I play my part to improve diversity and shine a light on the situation (I’m by no means on the level of Rejoice Ojiaku &#x26; Wilhemina Gilbertson-Davis but I do what I can), I can’t help but notice many individuals or institutions take their foot off the gas months after the 2020 protests and we’re back where we were as a community. I’m neither surprised nor too disappointed as I entered the industry knowing this was how things were (although I’ve had my eyes opened wider as time has gone on). But fundamentally, many at the top don’t really want diversity in SEO, don’t know what it is, or care about it if understand it.

We're constantly being told the food we eat causes any number of ailments - from dementia to cancer - and some may well contribute to that and other health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Racism is rife, the gulf between rich and poor continues to grow as well as disparity between genders, disabilities, religions. So when two adults want to engage in activities that bring them momentary joy before their holiday or business meeting or whatever they're travelling for, should they stop what they're doing and \"grow up?\" No.\n\nWe all need some downtime and relief from the world around us. Relaxation is fundamental for our mental health. Life is stressful enough as it is. I love the airport but I've not always enjoyed the process of getting their, sorting out the bags, checking you've got your passport, checking in, baggage drop offm boarding passes, going through customs, taking stuff out of your bags, being searched, all the incessant queueing. Where's the respite? If a man wants to use a colouring book and a woman play on her phone, _just let them_. Who are they harming? It's not business of anyone to be telling someone how to live their lives unless they cause undue pain on others. This does not fall in that category.

We’re constantly being told the food we eat causes any number of ailments - from dementia to cancer - and some may well contribute to that and other health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Racism is rife, the gulf between rich and poor continues to grow as well as disparity between genders, disabilities, religions. So when two adults want to engage in activities that bring them momentary joy before their holiday or business meeting or whatever they’re travelling for, should they stop what they’re doing and “grow up?” No.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We all need some downtime and relief from the world around us. Relaxation is fundamental for our mental health. Life is stressful enough as it is. I love the airport but I’ve not always enjoyed the process of getting their, sorting out the bags, checking you’ve got your passport, checking in, baggage drop offm boarding passes, going through customs, taking stuff out of your bags, being searched, all the incessant queueing. Where’s the respite? If a man wants to use a colouring book and a woman play on her phone, \u003Cem>just let them\u003C/em>. Who are they harming? It’s not business of anyone to be telling someone how to live their lives unless they cause undue pain on others. This does not fall in that category.

It was lightweight at about 24 KB but because the rest of the site was so lean, it meant it had the highest outlay in terms of page weight. The person whose site it was made a snobby comment that irked me and it was enough for me to replace Karla with the \u003Ca href=\"https://systemfontstack.com/\">system font stack\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do I regret the change? No, I think it was sensible. But did that mean never using webfonts on my site again? Also no as you might have seen with the title of this blog post and every heading on the site. I felt that the old font, Arial Black, didn’t quite do it for me and wanted a serif/display font that wasn’t too heavy but also had an elegant aesthetic. I ended up with DM Serif Display and I think it works well and it’s lightweight (around 24kb for one font). Yes, it’s still the biggest overhead but jesus it’s only 24 KB. The most popular sites on the Web have page weights and requests sizes of over 1mb on average and they get away with it.

Whether you want to be the best SEO (that's an impossible tasks as I will never relinquish my title!!!) or just want to do your job and leave at the end of your day, you don't **need** Python in your career.

It has changed my life and career for the better!\n3. In the first few months, I felt incredibly overwhelmed, inadequate, and frustrated because I kept seeing other people doing these amazing things and I didn't feel like I'd be able to do those things ever.\n4. Because of that, I tried to skip the basics and go straight to the hard stuff which fell apart because I didn't understand the Stack Overflow code I was copying and pasting (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!). This lead to more frustration and headaches\n5. Eventually, I realised I was puttting the horse before the cart and I went back to [the Python course I'd started](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/).\n6. I still copy and paste Stack Overflow code but this time I understand it a little better. Sometimes I don't but it works so I don't care (we've all done it so don't you **dare** scoff!)\n7. My background in coding before this was only in HTML and CSS. I tried JavaScript but it pissed me off so much and now we don't get on but I tolerate it because I have to.

If you know me for Python, you should also know I most of my personal scripts print out words and numbers or data into CSV files.\n10. [The script that I wrote about about a week ago](/posts/introducing-ralts/) took hours to make. My first major script took days, lots of headaches, and it's still a mess and could probably be cleaned up.\n10a. If you learn, embrace the mess. Don't neaten it up until you get it working and even then you don't necessarily _have_ to but if you're planning on explaining how it works, I recommend you make it presentable.\n10b. Actually, it's best to write comments to explain your code to yourself at least. That makes it easier to debug.\n11. If in doubt, print out lines of code to see if they don't work\n12. Python courses, group learning, and 1-2-1 tuition are all good ways to learn if they match your learning style. Exploring documentation, blog posts, and videos. There is no right or wrong way to learn Python!\n13. Python is most associated with automation but it can do almost anything\n14. Don't listen to people who tell you NOT to learn Python because it's slow or it won't get you a job. They're not that cute, their hair's uneven, and they look dusty.\n14a. Also don't listen to people who tell that you MUST learn Python or you'll \"fall behind\". There are plenty of \"experts\" making a lot of money out of antiquated SEO practices who are considered successful and influential. While I wouldn't recommend either path, SEO is expansive enough that you can't be \"less\". I don't hear anyone saying this kind of thing about JavaScript and that is arguably more important in the grander scheme of SEO things.\n15. Despite my growing reputation with Python, I still haven't finished my Python course and I still have to look up how things work because I don't always remember\n16. After a while, I realised most of the blog posts on SEJ et al weren't relevant to me so I skimmed them and moved on. If I concentrated on them too much, I'd have a fraught relationship with Python and myself for not getting it\n16a. Most of what you see probably won't help your client, employer, or your own personal projects in the way that is portrayed because it often requires deeper explanation, buy-in, and more immediate results because you'll likely take a long time to write and test the scripts, and people put a premium on that time when it's unknown to them.\n17. Learn it if you think it's cool and interesting and want to see how it works. It's absolutely cool if you do little things for yourself and move on. That's not failure and even if it was, at least you succeeded at trying it.\n18. To echo the sentiments of Miracle Inameti-Archibong in her recent Women In Tech SEO talk, play with existing code that's already out there. You don't have to create new ones.\n18a. From a learning perspective, it might be easier for you to use an existing script, find a fault or improvement, and do that one specific thing. Congrats&mdash;you just learnt how to code!\n\nYou can contact me (links are on the homepage) if you ever want to chat about Python, my experiences, how to get started, what I've used it for, anything. For us to enjoy and grow, we need love, care, and a sense of community. Everyone should be safe with the decisions they make, whether that means learning Python or not. I can't guarantee it won't be overwhelming because I still feel that way sometimes. But there are people around to ask for help (including me) and you're within your rights to take a deep breath, close your laptop and leave it for a day, week, or month until you're ready to come back. Or just leave it there. There are no obligations other than the ones you set yourself. It's good to be disciplined with how you learn as it can build structure to learn and grow but that shouldn't come at the expense of your peace. Python isn't _that_ cool!\n\nI think I've lost track of this post. Where was I? [Oh, yeah.

I always tried to shy away from it, pretending there wasn’t an issue; “I’m okay with rock music, I just don’t love it”. The truth is, I was barely okay with it. My idea of rock was everyone’s idea of pop music. It was always a genre that I neglected when it came to acquiring music, after all, I’ve yet to physically buy a rock CD. Plenty of pop, soul, jazz, hip hop, funk and even acid jazz. But no rock. And why is this? What’s the big deal? Well, today for the first time, I sat down and thought about it on my way to London (on a trip to some music shops, no less) and during the journey, I attributed it to two things.\n\nThe first one was a childhood memory of my dad being in a mood for some reason (usually because of me) and going upstairs to his room and listening to his Meat Loaf tape. Sometimes, he’d be downstairs listening to them on vinyl. Back then, he called them heavy metal and having never actually heard them myself, I took this to be true. At 21, I now know they are nowhere near being heavy metal and they actually sound good but the negative association of Meat Loaf, and by extension, rock music was enough to put me off listening to it. At that age, rock music was music for people who were angry or upset and/or people who were angry or upset with me. The second association came years later while I was at college.\n\nI liked a girl who was into rock and metal. Still wasn’t my thing at the time, but I liked her and tried to embrace it. I did a good job for a few months, until things went awry. And the music seemed to go hand in hand. Band of choice? My Chemical Romance, with a bit of Slipknot and System of a Down to boot. When you already feeling a bit emo, this is NOT the music you want to be listening to. Unfortunately, I liked Welcome To The Black Parade and had it on my iPod for the occasion. This was probably a worse association than the previous one. At least my dad could get over his mood and go back to playing John Holt and Michael Bolton. There was no real reprieve here other than totally removing myself from the group and the music. The latter came quicker than the former and left me hoping I’d never hear that music again.\n\nAnd I did a good 4 year run, until this year. Thankfully, no MCR but the rock returned and this time, there was no negative association attached. Why? Because the person that brought it back was my girlfriend. Now, when it comes to music, I can be quite snobbish at times. I tweet about rubbish artists and their lack of talent and regard for decent melodies everyday. But when your girlfriend is involved, you have to really stop and think. And listen. So I had a choice: either continue down the route of disliking anything remotely heavy when it came to rock or accept there was a problem and try and remedy it. The vote was unanimous (well, after a few initial criticisms but she’s so lovely, I couldn’t really continue with them) and I chose to give rock music one last go. I started easy with bands I liked on a basic level: Muse. I already liked Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. I listened to Absolution and quite enjoyed it. As they were one of her favourite bands, that was an easy win. Gave Paramore a go (well one song) and really liked Ignorance. Starting to get better.\n\nThe bigger test was the Foo Fighters. Now, I felt the same way about them as I did with Muse, ie. they’re alright. Always knew Dave Grohl was cool, so that helped. On my way to London today, I listened through their latest album, Wasting Light. Knowing there’d be some hard stuff on it, I was a little apprehensive. The contemplation of memories flooding back of college and the emo phase. I played through it anyway… and I wasn’t disappointed. In fact, I was hooked after just 20 seconds. Not one bad track on the whole album (which I will review this week). I don’t have anything to really compare it to (yet), but it really blew me away. I was bobbing my head to the parts that I was worried about. For the first time in my entire life, I was loving a rock album. It was all thanks to my girlfriend, who inadvertently gave me the determination to break the stigma I had attached to the second biggest genre in popular music. I was already hating current pop music (another genre I may have to try and immerse myself in for the same reason) and with rock, I was hating on about 70% of all popular music.\n\nBut not anymore.

I knew to take that 90% stat with a pinch of salt but wanted to try it.\n\nFor my prompt, I tried something I've been using on GPT3.5:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"prompt-box\">Write a four-sentence blog post about the hundred dollar bill in the style of [...].\u003C/div>\n\nAnd the output:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"output-box\">The hundred dollar bill is a denomination of United States currency. It features a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and an eagle flying over a rocky shore on the reverse. In recent years, the hundred dollar bill has become increasingly popular as a medium of exchange, particularly in the underground economy and in online transactions. Despite its widespread use, the hundred dollar bill remains a symbol of wealth and prestige, and is often associated with luxury and success.\u003C/div>\n\nSounds believable... but it's not all true. There isn't a flying eagle nor a rocky shore on the back. The rest is generic and subjective. It certainly wasn't in the style of the person I used.\u003Csup>[\u003Ca href=\"#in-1\">1\u003C/a>]\u003C/sup>\n\nNow to test the chatbot element. I prompted Vicuna to reword the previous output \"in the style of Don King\". I wanted something ostentatious and my mind went to Don King as I've used boxing related prompts in the past. Here's the result:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"output-box\">Yo, what's good people! Let me tell you about the hundred dollar bill. It's a big deal, ya hear me? This piece of paper with Benny Franklin's mug on it is what's up, Tinseltown! It's got the power to make your dreams come true, or at least get you some fancy threads and a fancy car. But don't get it twisted, this bill is not just for the rich and famous, it's for anyone who's got the hustle and the flow. So if you're looking to make some serious cash, don't sleep on the hundred dollar bill, baby!\u003C/div>\n\nOut. Standing(ly bad).\n\nIt's a **very** bad caricature of Don King but it made me laugh _because_ it was so bad. I could see a crap (probably white, almost certainly cis male) comedian try this style of comedy and flop.\n\n## More on Vicuna\n\n[Vicuna published a full breakdown of the model](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/), it's advantages, and disadvantages. The tl;dr: it's a good open-source alternative but it could never be as good as Bard/any GPT model. Unfortunately, the dataset isn't available and there are no plans to release it which is a shame and undermines the open-sourceness of it a little, but it might also be a legal thing; I dunno.\n\n## A different test\n\nI also used it to try and find a link between two randomly selected tags from my blogs. I got 'bell hooks' and 'Tony Hawk' and this is what it said:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"prompt-box\">Give me an entity that links bell hooks and Tony Hawk\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"output-box\">It is not immediately clear what connection, if any, exists between bell hooks and Tony Hawk. bell hooks is an American author, feminist, and social activist, known for her critical race theory and gender studies. She is a professor at the City University of New York and has written many books on topics such as race, gender, and sexuality. Tony Hawk, on the other hand, is an American professional skateboarder, actor, and television personality, known for his career in skateboarding and his appearances on television shows such as \"The Tony Hawk Show\" and \"Proving Ground\". It is not clear how these two individuals would be linked, as their areas of expertise and interests seem to be quite different.\u003C/div>\n\nCoherent and fairly true. I wouldn't have expected an open-source model to find a deeper connection than I would have found besides them both being American.\n\nI also tried Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and jewelry:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"output-box\">One possible entity that links jewelry and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the character April O'Neil, who is a human character in the TMNT franchise and is often depicted wearing jewelry. April is a journalist who becomes the turtles' ally and friend, and she is often shown wearing various types of jewelry, such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. The turtles themselves are also sometimes shown wearing jewelry, such as necklaces or headbands, particularly in the early cartoon series. In addition, there are many pieces of TMNT-themed jewelry that have been created for fans of the franchise, such as rings, pendants, and charm bracelets featuring the turtles and other characters from the series.\u003C/div>\n\nAgain, plausible. The last part in particular inspired me to find this piece of [TMNT-themed jewelry](https://cultrface.co.uk/check-out-this-iced-tmnt-pendant/) which I blogged about. And that's the beauty of this tech. To paraphrase Joe MacMillan from Halt and Catch Fire, \"AI isn't the thing; it's the thing that gets you to the thing.\" AI can't give me a finished product but it can certainly help me get there, alongside my ingenuity.\n\n## Caveats\n\nAs we saw in the very first prompt + output, hallucinations are still a big flaw and it gets bigger with open source models created from better closed-source models. The idea is to take what's there and refine and pre-train it on high quality training data to perform specific tasks. That's where this tech excels. Where you'll find outliers and inconsistent performance is trying to turn this proverbial black box into a Tower of Babel but that isn't stopping every AI startup from trying.\n\nI tried another pair of entities to see how they were linked (Martin Luther King and Cuba) and the model's output said MLK had visited Cuba in 1960. That didn't happen. These things aren't great for factual information, even when you hook them up to the internet—you know, that completely factual and never wrong platform of knowledge.\n\nThese aren't particularly good prompts either, I must admit. I also haven't run enough tests to get any significant evidence of anything and to be honest, I didn't even a hypothesis since I was just testing stuff out.\n\nIf you're trying to prove anything, for or against LLMs, you need a robust hypothesis and qualitiative and quantative tests. Prompts are only as \"good\" as the LLMs who fall in line for them.\n\n### More on AI\n\n* [/prompt-engineering.md](/posts/prompt-engineering/)\n* [/ai-is-a-lot-like-an-orange.md](/posts/ai-is-a-lot-like-an-orange/)\n* [/future-coca-cola-slogans-ai.md](/posts/future-coca-cola-slogans-ai/)\n* [/a-poem-about-how-search-engines-cant-interpret-poems.md](/posts/a-poem-about-how-search-engines-cant-interpret-poems/)\n* [Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting](https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-transactional-prompting)\n\n\u003CIcebergNotes>\n\t\u003Cp id=\"in-1\">\u003Csup>1\u003C/sup>I didn't expect perfection or 100% truth (and neither should you!)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/IcebergNotes>","src/content/posts/vicuna-made-me-laugh.mdx","047005578bf16bcb","vicuna-made-me-laugh.mdx","github-as-a-cms",{"id":6712,"data":6714,"body":6721,"filePath":6722,"digest":6723,"legacyId":6724,"deferredRender":38},{"title":6715,"description":6716,"published":38,"tags":6717,"pubDate":6720},"GitHub as a CMS?","Sometimes, the second best solution is right in front of you.",[6718,6719,281,4077,1156,1006],"GitHub","CMS",["Date","2025-08-16T23:00:00.000Z"],"import IcebergNotes from '../../components/IcebergNotes.astro';\n\nI've been interested in heuristics lately and I think this counts as one.

I normally do this from my laptop using Sublime Text and GitHub Desktop but if I'm away from my laptop and I want to make a change immediately, what can I do?\n\nThe answer lies with GitHub itself.\n\nGitHub has a smartphone app on Android and iOS where you can access your repositories just like on the website and you can edit files from it (a relatively recent addition, surprisingly). That means I can create, edit, and delete posts as I see fit and all the changes get pushed and deployed as normal.\n\nIt's not super intuitive and if you make a mistake with a file name, for example, you can't change it so you have to be careful. But managing your blogs and pages and jotting things down is possible and you can push as you go. I enjoy not having to wait until I get home to transfer my Google Keep notes to my local site repo or having ideas live and die in my head.\n\nAdding an element of spontaneity also helps with continued creativity and I think you can do this with other static site generator with a similar setup. All you need is the repo, GitHub Actions that run the build, and a means of deployment.

But this one comes from his second alter-ego, Shrill Evans. It's a sub-20-minute journey through jazz and classical beats from the 18th century all the way to the present day. Shrill Evans' name takes inspiration from Bill Evans, the late jazz pianist who was classically trained at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music in New York. MONOLITH is a nod to him and the music that fuelled his prolific career. The album was produced, mixed, and mastered by Shrill himself, using his trusty SP-303 for added grit. Fans who download the album will get an exclusive bonus track of Shrill Evans live at The Ternhill Grove in Bradford, his one and only performance back in 1995. ✝ for jazz * for classical","monolith.jpg",["Date","2019-04-29T23:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith","src/content/music/monolith.md","db102eb600f71fad",{"html":7368,"metadata":7369},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/monolith\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":7370,"localImagePaths":7371,"remoteImagePaths":7372,"frontmatter":7373,"imagePaths":7375},[],[],[],{"title":7360,"linerNotes":7361,"pubDate":7374,"image":7362},"30 Apr 2019",[],"monolith.md","mumbo-jumbo",{"id":7377,"data":7379,"body":7384,"filePath":7385,"digest":7386,"rendered":7387,"legacyId":7396},{"title":7380,"linerNotes":7381,"image":7382,"pubDate":7383},"Mumbo Jumbo","noun: language or ritual causing or intended to cause confusion or bewilderment.","mumbo-jumbo.jpg",["Date","2018-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo","src/content/music/mumbo-jumbo.md","9b2e62ee57272712",{"html":7388,"metadata":7389},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/mumbo-jumbo\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":7390,"localImagePaths":7391,"remoteImagePaths":7392,"frontmatter":7393,"imagePaths":7395},[],[],[],{"title":7380,"linerNotes":7381,"pubDate":7394,"image":7382},"11 Nov 2018",[],"mumbo-jumbo.md","nighttime",{"id":7397,"data":7399,"body":7404,"filePath":7405,"digest":7406,"rendered":7407,"legacyId":7415},{"title":7400,"linerNotes":7401,"image":7402,"pubDate":7403},"NiGHTTiME","Dedicated to late night TV.","nighttime.jpg",["Date","2020-08-21T23:00:00.000Z"],"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime","src/content/music/nighttime.md","f833831a8020aa99",{"html":7408,"metadata":7409},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime\">https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/album/nighttime\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":7410,"localImagePaths":7411,"remoteImagePaths":7412,"frontmatter":7413,"imagePaths":7414},[],[],[],{"title":7400,"linerNotes":7401,"pubDate":237,"image":7402},[],"nighttime.md","nomad",{"id":7416,"data":7418,"body":7423,"filePath":7424,"digest":7425,"rendered":7426,"legacyId":7435},{"title":7419,"linerNotes":7420,"image":7421,"pubDate":7422},"NOMAD","nomad /ˈnəʊmad/ noun a member of a people that travels from place to place to find fresh pasture for its animals and has no permanent home. a person who does not stay long in the same place; a wanderer.
