## 1. Gen 2 (Gold/Silver/Crystal)

**Why I love it**: It built on everything I loved about Gen 1 and made it such an enjoyable gen.

## 2. Gen 1 (Red/Green/Blue/Yellow)

**Why I love it**: It's the gen that started it all.

## 3. Gen 8 (Sword/Shield/Legends: Arceus)

**Why I love it**:

## 4. Gen 3 (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen)

**Why I love it**:

## 5. Gen 4 (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver)

**Why I love it**:

## 6. Gen 9 (Scarlet/Violet)

**Why I love it**:

## 7. Gen 6 (X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire)

**Why I love it**:

## 8. Gen 5 (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver)

**Why I love it**: This used to be at the bottom of the list because I really didn't enjoy Black and White. However, Game Freak did the thing with Black 2/White 2. It felt like a modern JRPG and they went hard with the dragon-mech-dystopia lore in a way I didn't expect. The cutscenes aren't too invasive and the bits with the frigate and the Kyurem vs Reshiram/Zekrom are spectactular. That said, I still don't like BW so that's why it's down here.

## 9. Gen 7 (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver)

**Why I love it**: Placing this at the bottom seems harsh but it's just that all the other gens appealed to me more. SM/USUM suffered greatly from a bloated storyline with way too many cut scenes that stilted my enjoyment of the games. There were plenty of good Pokémon but the poor gameplay outweighed them.
