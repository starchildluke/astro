As long as you have intent, it doesn't matter whether your scribbles are intelligible or notâ€”you are a writer.

Don't be fooled by capitalist traditions. People who write books aren't the only writers in the world. Everyone is a writer but not everyone is a [novelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Morrison), or a [journalist](https://www.glamour.com/story/8-black-women-journalists-on-reporting-police-brutality), a [blogger](http://www.blackbritishbloggers.com/), a [calligraphist](https://www.seblester.com/), a student, a [researcher](https://www.cam.ac.uk/bhmresearchers), a data entry clerk, a typographer, or a [teacher](https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/teacher-support/what-its-like-to-be-a-black-teacher-in-the-uk-today/zhfxdp3). When you add specificity, that's when you can exclude yourself.

Writing is for all.
