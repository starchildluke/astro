I'm taking time away from my two main Twitter accounts (I have a lot). All the news and rumours and hysteria and jokes about COVID-19 are getting too much and it's downright depressing. I'm annoyed by the response to the virus from the government and other authorities that directly affect me. Peoples' lives aren't the primary concern and it's disgusting and very telling. But that's all I'll say on that.

I'm also not feeling 100% (don't worry, it's not the virus) and I'm "self-isolating" this weekend. All I've done today is watch YouTube and occasionally eaten and drunk but I do need to drink more. By doing that, I've ignored everything on TV and social media and it's reminded me that future isolation won't be so bad for me. I also realised that I have a high level of privilege for feeling that way.

Time published an article called [Why the Coronavirus Outbreak Could Hit Women Hardest](https://time.com/5801897/women-affected-covid-19/) discussing the harmful effects of isolation from the virus for women at risk from domestic violence. It's a subsection of society most of us - including me - won't have thought about. There are also people most at risk of catching the virus and suffering further health complications. COVID-19 has already killed nearly 6,000 people at the time of writing. As I sit in my flat, I think of all those people. I should do that more often.
