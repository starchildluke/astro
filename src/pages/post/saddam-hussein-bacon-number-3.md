From a [Brewers' fan forum](https://brewerfanatic.com/forums/topic/7164-six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon/?do=findComment&comment=23095) in 2007:

> Saddam Hussein was in Dix, Les (2003) with Nelson Mandela
> Nelson Mandela was in Malcolm X (1992) with Matt Dillon (I)
> Matt Dillon (I) was in Loverboy (2005) with Kevin Bacon
