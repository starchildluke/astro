Here is my recipe – Banana Rum Cake. It is roughly measured as I don’t have exact equipment here, but the recipe is very forgiving.

* 1 block of butter, 250g
* 1 and half cups of sugar
* 5 small eggs
* a quarter cup of dark rum
* one tablespoon of vanilla extract
* 4-7 bananas, depending on their size (I used 7 quite small ones)
* 4 cups of self raising flour

Heat oven to 180 degrees centigrade. Lightly butter and dust with flour three loaf tins. Cream together the sugar and butter, by hand or with a mixer. Add the eggs, rum and vanilla and beat well for a few minutes. Add the bananas, roughly mashed, and mix well together. Gently stir in the flour. Divide into three loaf tins. Bake for 50-60 minutes.
