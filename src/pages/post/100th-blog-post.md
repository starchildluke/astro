This is technically the 100th blog post on this iteration of my blog.

I know people don't read this blog often and some of the older posts are were actually brought over from now-defunct versions of this site but whatever, I love milestones!

To celebrate, here's a list of American cereals I'd buy if someone gave me £100 to spend in an American candy store (because I've been watching [Shonduras's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Shonduras) all weekend with my son and he loves cereal):

- Lucky Charms - £4.99
- Froot Loops Tropical - £5.99
- Froot Loops Wild Berry - £5.99
- Trix - £4.99
- Fruity Pebbles - £5.99
- Golden Crisp - £5.99
- Maple Cheerios - £5.99
- Raisin Bran - £5.49
- Corn Pops - £5.79
- Golden Grahams - £5.49
- French Toast Crunch - £5.99
- Cocoa Puffs - £4.99
- Cinnamon Toast Crunch - £5.99
- Apple Jacks - £1.99

(This list is unfinished.)
