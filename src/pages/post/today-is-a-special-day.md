29th January is special for two reasons.

1. On this day in 2017, Roger Federer won his 18th grand slam title. It meant a lot of me as I was going through a difficult period of my life and Federer is my sporting idol.

2. On this day in 2019, I got a new job that changed my life forever. I was leaving customer service and entering the world of digital marketing. I don't exaggerate when I say my 5 years working on the phones nearly destroyed me and after 8 years of trying to get in and failing (I openly admit to "giving up" a few times), the success was sweeter than ever. I started work as a copywriter two months later and the rest is history.

This date is a date of triumph. The last couple of years have been hell but on those two days in my life, I felt like I'd won the jackpot. I hope I can feel even a small amount of that today.
