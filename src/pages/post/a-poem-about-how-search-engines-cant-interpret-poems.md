_(The following is a poem about how search engines can't interpret poems. I've written it in jest and as an experiment--with a little help from OpenAI--to see how Google figures out its context, [based on this article about a tweet from John Mueller](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-cannot-interpret-poems-33968.html).)_

## "A poem about how search engines can't interpret poems" by Luke Davis

> Poems are like oceans
>
> Flowing through the blue
>
> Search engines are like ships
>
> On the hunt for something new
>
> But they can't always interpret
>
> The twists and turns of a poem
>
> The hidden meanings and symbols
>
> They just don't know 'em
>
> And all that is left is a bag of words
>
> That don't always make sense
>
> Or maybe that's the poet's fault
>
> For switching between past and present tense
>
> But search engines try their hardest
>
> Those pesky spider bots
>
> To interpret the context of some prose
>
> And connect those linguistic dots
