My fifth morsel is called Black Fabric and it's a Python script that generates five randomised names that incorporate:

* A fabric type as the first name
* A common surname of African diasporan descent (ie. Black folks from the Americas (North and Central), the Caribbean, and the UK, whose ancestors were enslaved people)

## Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

## Links

* [GitHub link](https://github.com/starchildluke/black_fabric)
* [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/starchildluke/black_fabric/main/black_fabric.py)
