If money was no object, I'd love to become a Web history expert for the period between 1989-2003(ish). That shit fascinates me. I fell down the internet rabbit hole in 2000 so I missed the first 10 years of the Web but from everything I've picked up over the years, it was a remarkable time. All I need is a massive windfall.
