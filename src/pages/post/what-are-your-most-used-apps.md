As of December 2021:

1. Chrome
2. YouTube
3. WhatsApp
4. Instagram
5. Spotify
6. Google Authenticator
7. Phone
8. Clock

Most of these are commonly used apps. Google Authenticator is in the list as I need to use it to log into accounts for work. As for Clock, that's because I use the timer whenever my son brushes his teeth so he gets into the routine or brushing for 2 minutes rather than ≤30 seconds (if he's not too tired, we use Pokémon Smile which is way more fun).
