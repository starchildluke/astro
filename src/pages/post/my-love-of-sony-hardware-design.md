I've not owned many Sony products but I've always admired their design. Here are some of my favourites.

## MiniDisc

![Sony MZ-N707 MD Walkman](/images/Sony-MZ-N707-MD-Walkman.jpg)

I've always wanted a MiniDisc Walkman ever since I saw my cousin with one. Obsolete is an understatement for this technology but still cool.

## Sony Xperia phone

I owned the Xperia Z5 but this model isn't far from it in terms of design. Simple and sleek, just how I like it.

## Walkman

I only had the CD Walkman with "shock protection" but the original can't be beaten. It's an iconic design and still works wonders if you can find a working model on eBay. Play your cassettes with ease and stay wired for sound.

## Playstation

I never got to own the PSone but I did have the original PlayStation and the PS2. The official controller is a work of ergonomic art and the PSone is wonderful and compact, in its soft grey shell.

## Sony ⍺

The Sony Alpha, or ⍺, looks incredible. I own a Canon but I wouldn't say no to one of these.

## Sony Cyber-shot

Another example of sleek and simple design, the Cybershot was a high quality point-and-click camera with its state-of-the-art Carl Ziess lens. If you saw a digital photo from the 00s, it was probably taken with a Cybershot.

## Xperia Tablet

This isn't the Zperia tablet I own but the range is great. It's not my #1 tablet range (that accolade belongs to the Google Nexus tablet  family) but it comes in at a close second with Sony's trademark polished look.

## Memory Stick Pro Duo

Not quite as obsolete as the MiniDisc but not far off. I don't know why I like this periphery so much but the typography is great. That's about it.
