Still super wild that I dropped out of a computer science degree when I was 18 and now I'm using machine learning, language models, and reading papers on this DAILY.

I have regrets from that time but I don't think I would have got into this kind of stuff had I stayed so it worked out well. Besides the thousands of pounds worth of debt. But hey, at least I graduated the second time!!!
