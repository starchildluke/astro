I'm a big fan of Marijn van Hoorn's blogosphere and they wrote a piece on [how they got vaccinated](https://marijn.uk/thegarden/12021/03/vaccinated/). My favourite line was the last one:

> It’s been a day, and other than a dull annoyance in my upper arm and a sudden urge to buy a Windows Phone, i haven’t noticed any symptoms. I’ve heard the Pfizer one is worse on the second go, though, so wish me luck!

That's a pretty serious side effect! A Windows Phone in 2021? I hope they don't actually buy it with the second vaccine.

[And to think I bought one](/post/my-phone-history/) without a needle or a vaccine.
