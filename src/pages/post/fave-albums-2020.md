Hopefully by the end of the year, I'll have listened to 200 albums which I never expected to do. At the time of writing, I've listened to 195 and it's been a revelation. A lot of great music came out in a year where it would have been acceptable to curl into a ball and not want to create anything. But my favourite artists did and produced some of their best works to date.

The list below isn't a ranked list, although the top 7 are my overall top 7 for the year in a rough order. _Agüita_ is for sure my #1 and _Mordechai_ is a very close second. Knxwledge's _1988_ was so damn good, as was Ahwlee's _VII_ which was like a hip hop RKO outta nowhere. The biggest surprise was Maelo Ruiz's _La Unica_, a salsa album I would never have found if it wasn't for a Python script I created (I might publish it some day).

Anyway, enjoy and buy them if you can!
