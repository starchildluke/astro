I'm tired of watching movies on Amazon Prime Video and there not being any subtitles available. And these aren't obscure movies - I'm talking films with famous actors in them.

But that shouldn't matter because all films should have subtitles available: for disabled people, neurodivergent people, people who don't understand the language the film's in, and all the various intersections.

Or people like me who can't stand actors mumbling their lines (or might be in the kitchen making dinner while the film's on).

But I'm at the bottom of the priority list.
