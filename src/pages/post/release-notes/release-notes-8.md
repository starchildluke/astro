After 2 years of a horrific pandemic (still going btw), I'd hoped-but not necessarily expected- that we'd have learnt more about ourselves, how to be compassionate, and organise against oppressors.

But all I see is calls to work HARDER and people doubling down on being shitty. And if you call it out? You're the inconsiderate one.

Rest? Wasted time. You should be finding a hustle to make passive income. Fight 'cancel culture', fight 'woke culture'. Instagram infographics with 5 word quips. Nonsense, fear, and greed. Manufactured moral panic. No critical thinking, just bad vibes.

It's sad and a damn shame.
