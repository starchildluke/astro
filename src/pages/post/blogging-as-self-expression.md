All you bloggers out there, or spouses of bloggers, what effects do you notice?

For me, it's about self-expression (alongside self-experimentation). I work as an SEO for 35 hours a week so my entire career revolves around the Web. But there are limits to what I can do with that because I have responsibility to my employer and my clients. Outside those hours, [I can blog about anything I want](/wiki/blogging/) and say whatever I want (within reason of course). If I want to write a blog post comprised of a single sentence or a sole image, I can. I love that freedom and it took me a while to fully embrace it.

As for tolerance to human differences, I'm quite the opposite because human differences often involve oppression and I refuse to tolerate that in any form. I don't blog about things I don't agree with because plenty of other people do that and that's not what I blog for. People may allude that to an echo chamber but it's my party and I'll blog what I want toâ€”notably what _I_ believe in with conviction.

The effects of all of this is a change in how I consume media and how I engage with it. I tweeted last night how my connection with Twitter, and social media in general, had diminished. I don't read my TL as much as specific lists that give me exactly what I want and nothing more. It saves me doomscrolling and I can be online without wishing I wasn't (as much). Blogging is my outlet and escape from whatever the hell is happening out there and it has saved me during this pandemic.
