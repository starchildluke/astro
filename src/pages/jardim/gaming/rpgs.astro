              <p>Role-playing games (commonly known as <strong>RPGs</strong>) are a video game genre focused on story telling, character development, and elements of combat. The most traditional type of RPG is the turn-based RPG where your character and your enemies take turns to attack. However, a lot of modern RPGs have a real-time combat system where you can both attack at the same time.</p>
              <p>There is plenty of nuance within the genre, with a lot of games breaking out of the tropes originally set by their predecessors (it's not all swords and medieval times).</p>
