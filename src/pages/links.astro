          <p>This is like a blogroll but not all the links are blogs. Having a page of links might not be the cool thing to do anymore but it's a nice way to "give back" to the sites you enjoy the most. And let's be honest, if you see links, you're gonna want to click on them to see where they take you. That's the joy of the internet and hypermediaâ€”discovery!</p>
