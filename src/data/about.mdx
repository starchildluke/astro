I am a **senior technical SEO specialist**. I love the Web and fell down the world wide wabbit hole back in 2000, before I started coding in HTML myself. Since then, my work journey has taken me on the following trip:

_Graphic design > mathematics > a music tech degree > 7 years in customer service > copywriting > SEO > technical SEO_

I was born in Bradford, spent most of my life in Luton (via Atlanta for 6 months in 2000), but currently live in Nottingham.

I'm **Black** (with a capital B), cisgender (he/him), **pansexual**, **neurodivergent**, and [Probably Autistic](/posts/probably-autistic/).

I love [Python](/jardim/tech/python/), **HTML**, **CSS**, and I'm slowly warming to **JavaScript**. If you want to know what tech I use, check out my <a href="/uses/">Uses page</a>.

I create for people, not algorithms.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching [sports](/jardim/sport/), playing [Pokémon](/jardim/pokemon/) and reliving my childhood with [old computer games](/jardim/gaming/) and cartoons on YouTube. I love [modernist architecture](/jardim/architecture/), Mies van der Rohe, and [Roger Federer](/jardim/sport/roger-federer/).

I have a degree in Music Technology and [I've been making music since 2010](https://strrchildluke.bandcamp.com/).

I've been learning Portuguese since 2017.

And **Free Palestine**, give back their land, end the occupation, and ceasefire now!

## Colophon

I’ve had so many versions of this site, I’ve lost count. It originally started life as starcrazy.org back in 2009(?) but eventually, I moved over to lukealexdavis.co.uk in 2010. Since then, it’s taken the form of a blog and a hand-coded personal site with numerous cosmetic changes.

Now, the site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The fonts I'm using are Erode Bold for headings and your device's default system font for body text.
