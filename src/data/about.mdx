## About the site (aka the colophon)

I’ve had so many versions of this site, I’ve lost count. It originally started life as starcrazy.org back in 2009(?) but eventually, I moved over to lukealexdavis.co.uk in 2010. Since then, it’s taken the form of a blog and a hand-coded personal site with numerous cosmetic changes.

Now, the site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [IONOS](https://www.ionos.co.uk/) [(referral link)](http://aklam.io/9o3lTc).

The fonts I'm using are Erode Bold for headings and your device's default system font for body text.

The green used on the site is `#285f2b`, or `rgb(41, 95, 43)` if you'd prefer.

My relationship with the Web has influenced how I’ve made and remade this site, from FrontPage Express to Microsoft FrontPage to Dreamweaver to Sublime Text. Other influences include:

* [Tatiana Mac](https://www.tatianamac.com/)
* [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/)

## Identity and pronouns

I'm cisgender man, pansexual, and my pronouns are he/him/his.
