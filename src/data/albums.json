      "album": "Donuts",
      "release_date": "2006",
      "importance": "It changed how I listened to hip hop and sampling in particular. I learn something new every time I listen to it or read about it. Donuts is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time and the pinnacle of last musical salvos."
    },
    {
      "artist": "Donald Fagen",
      "album": "The Nightfly",
      "release_date": "1982",
      "importance": "I can't stop listening to The Nightfly. I'll think about it and I *need* to hear it in full."

    {
      "artist": "Michael Jackson",
      "album": "Off The Wall",
      "release_date": "1979",
      "importance": "The start of Michael's iconic solo collab with Quincy Jones and one of many examples of why disco never died."

      "album": "Dangerous",
      "release_date": "1991",

      "album": "VII",
      "release_date": "2020",

    {
      "artist": "Madvillain",
      "album": "Madvillainy",
      "release_date": "2004",
      "importance": "A bit like Donuts, Madvillainy has this lore that might overtake the music for some but, for me, they're jostling for dominance in my mindâ€”and that's a good thing."
    },
    {
      "artist": "Roberta Flack",
      "album": "Oasis",
      "release_date": "1988",
      "importance": "Oasis was released way out of Roberta Flack's most successful period. But quality and popularity aren't mutually inclusive. This album holds sentimental value as my dad played a few tracks from it (via her greatest hits) and it represents pleasant times from my childhood."
