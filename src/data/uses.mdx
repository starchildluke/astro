(Note: items in _italic_ are use for work and personal use. This is also a work in progress so stay tuned for updates!)

## For work

* **_MacBook Air_**: After my MacBook Pro fell apart, I got myself a M1 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 500GB storage. It's as fast as I need it to be and does what I need it to do. I also have one provided by work but I rarely use it as I have all my favourite apps and things on my personal one (and admin access)
* **Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse**: They came with all work stuff and while the keyboard is great, the ergonomics of the mouse are notoriously bad
* **_Screaming Frog_**: a Web crawling client for when I need to quickly crawl some pages or a whole site. For more in depth analysis, I use...
* **_Sitebulb_**: a more robust crawling option but it can be a bit finicky with its reports when crawling JavaScript sites
* **_Google Search Console_**: the easiest solution for assessing crawling and indexation
* **_Python_**: Python comes up a fair amount in my work as a way to automate and obtain data faster. I mainly use **Jupyter Notebook** as opposed to Terminal to get stuff done as I can troubleshoot better and split code to get at least some data if there are restrictions.
* **Google Workspace**: Gmail, Meet, Docs, Sheets, Slides, you know the stuff.
* **_Sublime Text_**: For work, I often use Sublime Text for its Regex capabilities or to edit Python scripts. Outside of work, I use it for editing this website.
* **_Notion_**: I mainly use Notion for storing album/track name ideas because...
* **_Keep_**: ...I use Keep for note taking!
* **_Todoist_**: My autistic brain **needs** this app, so I can keep track of what I need to do and mark off what I have done everyday.
* **_Pocket_**: The place where saved articles go to rot (just kidding, I do read them eventually). I've also started saving memes here to share with my loved ones.
* **_GitHub_**: Without GitHub, I don't know if this site would exist, at least in this way.

## Personal use

* **Terminal**: I use ohmyzsh now, although I haven't used its extensive features yet. Otherwise, I have Terminal on all the time and it's an integral part of this site's functionality
* **Firefox**: I've used all the major browsers and after using Brave for 3 years, I moved to Firefox at the end of last year. It's been pretty smooth, although not being able to `Cmd + Shift + V` in Google Sheets is very annoying.
* **Airmail**: Easy email client to use.
* **iMovie**: I can't afford proper video editing software so I use iMovie for all my meme/rudimentary music video needs
* **Ableton Live**: My DAW of choice. I love Ableton. Been using it since 2020.
* **Cyberduck**: My FTP client of choice, mainly because the duck is cute. And it's reliable.
* **Spotify**: How I listen to most of my music. Problematic but using my (4th) broken iPod classic isn't sustainable these days
* **Raindrop**: Where I save articles to blog about. [I wrote about it being part of my content flow](/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/) a while back.
* **Splice**: I use this for royalty-free samples (mostly drum hits and melodies). I have so many tokens but if I cancel, I lose access :(
* **Discord**: How I keep in touch with friends and keep up to date with certain things like Astro and Pokémon. Although I don't use it as much because of that [shitty AI data selling thing](https://lifehacker.com/tech/discord-data-sold-to-ai-and-law-enforcement)
* **GitHub Desktop**: Easier to use this than the main site for deploying stuff
* **Transmission**: I've been using this for torrents after Vuze's malware put me off. Clean and easy to use.
* **DeepL**: When I remember, I use this over Google Translate ([also wrote about why on Cultrface](https://cultrface.co.uk/is-deepl-the-best-google-translate-alternative/))
* **Pika**: My colour contrast app of choice. The colours always have cool names!
* **Parallels Desktop**: How I use Windows so I can play my favourite Windows games and apps
* **Tunnelbear**: My VPN of choice. It's not ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or Surfshark, but the bear is adorable and it does what I need. (I'm not sponsored... but if you're listening, Tunnelbear...)
* **PS4 Pro**: [I bought this in early 2024](https://distantarcade.co.uk/dragon-quest-makes-me-want-to-get-a-ps4/) and I love it. Cheaper than a suped-up PC and I can play Dragon Quest in 4K!
* **Nintendo Switch**: I mainly use this to play Pokémon and it's no 3DS but whatever. I have so many Nintendo consoles.
