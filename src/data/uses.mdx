(Note: items in _italic_ are use for work and personal use. This is also a work in progress so stay tuned for updates!)

## For work

* **_MacBook Air_**: After my MacBook Pro fell apart, I got myself a M1 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 500GB storage. It's as fast as I need it to be and does what I need it to do. I also have one provided by work but I rarely use it as I have all my favourite apps and things on my personal one (and admin access)
* **Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse**: They came with all work stuff and while the keyboard is great, the ergonomics of the mouse are notoriously bad
* **_Screaming Frog_**: a Web crawling client for when I need to quickly crawl some pages or a whole site. For more in depth analysis, I use...
* **_Sitebulb_**: a more robust crawling option but it can be a bit finicky with its reports when crawling JavaScript sites
* **_Google Search Console_**: the easiest solution for assessing crawling and indexation
* **_Python_**: Python comes up a fair amount in my work as a way to automate and obtain data faster. I mainly use **Jupyter Notebook** as opposed to Terminal to get stuff done as I can troubleshoot better and split code to get at least some data if there are restrictions.
* **Google Workspace**: Gmail, Meet, Docs, Sheets, Slides, you know the stuff.
* **_Sublime Text_**: For work, I often use Sublime Text for its Regex capabilities or to edit Python scripts. Outside of work, I use it for editing this website.
* **_Notion_**
* **_Todoist_**
* **_Pocket_**
* **_GitHub_**
