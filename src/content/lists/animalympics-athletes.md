Animalympics was a 1980 animated film directed by Steven Lisberger for the NBC network. It parodied the Summer and Winter Olympic Games and featured voice acting from the likes of Billy Crystal, Harry Shearer, Gilda Radner, and Michael Fremer.

I enjoyed it as a kid but hadn't seen it for over 20 years until today. I'd completely forgotten how funny the names were so I thought I'd list my favourites here.
