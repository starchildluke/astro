Since we're all doing Wrappeds of everything now, I thought I'd compile a list of my top Christmas movies since I started logging data on Letterboxd in 2018.
## Criteria
To qualify for the list, the films must fit the following criteria:
* They must be deemed a Christmas movie by my definition. I really don't care if you think Die Hard is or isn't a Christmas movie. Go touch grass.
* The film must have more than 1 watch logged between 2018 and whenever I update the list.
* The film must have an average rating of 3.5 or more (I rarely change my rating over multiple watch-throughs but it happens. I also disregard watches without ratings.)

As of 27th December 2024, this is the list:

| Film                           | Total watches | Avg. rating |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Batman Returns                 | 8             | 5.0         |
| Die Hard                       | 4             | 5.0         |
| How the Grinch Stole Christmas | 3             | 5.0         |
| The Christmas Contract         | 3             | 4.75        |
| Last Christmas                 | 3             | 4.0         |
| Home Alone                     | 2             | 4.0         |
| Trading Christmas              | 4             | 3.5         |
