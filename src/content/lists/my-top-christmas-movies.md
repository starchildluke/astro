Since we're all doing Wrappeds of everything now, I thought I'd compile a list of my top Christmas movies since I started logging data on Letterboxd in 2018.

## Criteria

To qualify for the list, the films must fit the following criteria:

* They must be deemed a Christmas movie by my definition. I really don't care if you think Die Hard is or isn't a Christmas movie. Go touch grass.
* Films with more than 1 watch logged between 2018 or films that I remmeber watching more than once are eligible.
* The film must have an average rating of 3 or more

As of 24th December 2025, this is the list:

| Film                           | Total watches | Avg. rating |
