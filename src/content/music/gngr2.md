linerNotes: "GNGR2 is the 8th album from Starchildluke's #Road2Switch series. It's the sequel to GENGARTAPE with a nod to anime series, Silent Mobius. This time, 93% of all proceeds go to the #Road2Switch fund and 7% goes to the Pea Foundation. ----- In front of me Raphael. Behind me, Gabriel. On my right Michael. On my left, Uriel. Five shining stars surrounding my four side raise flare. Six shining stars shine in the light pillar. Ater malkt va geblar ve deduler lu aurlam amen."
