title: 'THE Black Nerd Beat Tape'
linerNotes: "Terry Gant and Troy Hunter are friends of mine and host Stakes Is High: THE Black Nerd Podcast where they 'talk nerd s**t and things that they like', which includes sports, tech, comics, music, and whatever else attracts their attention. Since they both have exquisite taste in friends *ahem* and music, I decided to make a whole beat tape for them. It's free to download but any money you give will go to charity."
