title: 'NOQUEST III'
linerNotes: "NOQUEST III: The Genesis of Redemption is the third album in the NOQUEST series. The album's source material comes from the various lands and titles from the Dragon Quest franchise, and expanding its horizons beyond that world with a variety of film and TV skits. A little shorter than previous releases from the series, NOQUEST III is by no means light on jams with the likes of SLiME bringing some synth-infused funk and the boom bap rhythms on ToxicSword."
