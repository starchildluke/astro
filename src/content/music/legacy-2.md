title: 'Legacy'
linerNotes: "This year marks 10 years since my first ever release. I had a lot of different ideas for what I wanted Legacy to be but in the end, it was best to have it represent everything I've learnt over the last decade. This album pays homage to my past and retains my present way of working so I can learn from it in the future. That is my Legacy."
