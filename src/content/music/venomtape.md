title: 'VENOMTAPE'
linerNotes: "VENOMTAPE is the brand new beat tape from UK producer Starchildluke. It comes as part of a new series from the beat maker called #RoadToSwitch, where all proceeds will go towards a fund to get him a Nintendo Switch. VENOMTAPE is comprised of rock samples from the ages and some current numbers, in a similar vein to Madlib’s Rock Konducta project. “Venom is my favourite supervillain not called DOOM and I wanted to show my love in the best way I could: through music.” – Starchildluke"
