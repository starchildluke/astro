title: 'NOQUEST IV'
linerNotes: "NOQUEST IV: Chronicles of the Called One is the fourth album in the NOQUEST series. The album's source material comes from the various lands and titles from the Dragon Quest franchise, and expanding its horizons beyond that world with a variety of film and TV skits. NOQUEST IV may never have been recorded let alone released were it not for inspiration from other VGM music and a letting go of sorts. Sometimes the harder you push, the less you get out of it."
