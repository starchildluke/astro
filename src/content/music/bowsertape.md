title: 'BOWSERTAPE'
linerNotes: "BOWSERTAPE is the brand new beat tape from UK producer Starchildluke. It comes as part of a new series from the beat maker called #RoadToSwitch, where all proceeds will go towards a fund to get him a Nintendo Switch.  BOWSERTAPE is the second tape of the series and is made up of samples from mainly R&B and soul, with some easy listening and pop thrown in for good measure. “Bowser's pursuit of Princess Peach is notorious and problematic so I wanted to make an alternative love album on that concept.” – Starchildluke"
