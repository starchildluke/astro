title: 'NOQUEST'
linerNotes: "My latest hyperfixation is Dragon Quest so I decided to make some beats with that as my inspiration. 6 beats, an intro, an outro, lots of samples, film & TV references, slow jams and shuffling jawns. What's not to love on a release like this? Thanks for stopping by and listening! RIP Akira Toriyama"
