title: "felt cute, won't delete later x"
linerNotes: "On 2nd April 2022, I decided to take a trip and make this album in about 2 hours in a Starbucks. While the beats don't have a specific theme, the track names and album title reference MSN/txtspeak from the late 90s/early-to-mid 00s. One for the millennials. The album is 'pay what you want' so you can download it for free or pay a minimum of 0.50. If you can, I'd suggest a donation of Â£7 (or the equivalent in your currency)."
