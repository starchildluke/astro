title: 'Quarantine Sessions'
linerNotes: "The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over as we crawl into 2021. Our individual and collective mental health is flagging as governments continue to mismanage and gaslight entire populations to keep themselves and their rich friends happy and profitable. But amongst all that (and there's so much more), I've managed to find time and inspiration to make music. Quarantine Sessions is one of a few releases I'll put to this year as I celebrate my 10th anniversary making and releasing music. Enjoy, stay safe, and wear your masks!"
