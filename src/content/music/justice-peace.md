title: 'Justice&Peace'
linerNotes: "This album is a representation of my Blackness. The titles were created from a mix of my Jamaican heritage, my friends, Black people on social media, Black pop culture, my youth, and Black scholars I have grown close to through their works â€“ James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. It's not a melting pot. Nothing has been assimilated to make this LP. It's a salad of every part of my Blackness. It's a rough work in progress, full of imperfections that I accept as who I am. All money from sales of Justice&Peace will be doing to the following funds and organisations: The Free Black University
Humblebee Creative
Black Trans Travel Fund Because All Black Lives Matter and that must include All Black Women's Lives and All Black Trans Lives Matter or the movement is redundant. Thank you and stay safe. Justice&Peace."
