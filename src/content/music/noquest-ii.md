title: 'NOQUEST II'
linerNotes: "NOQUEST II: Architects of the Champion Bloodline is the second album in the NOQUEST series. The album's source material comes from the various lands and titles from the Dragon Quest franchise, including snippets from cut scenes, commercials, and even a soundbite from its creator, Yuji Horii. Tied together by Starchildluke's ever-evolving style and orchestration, this is the best one yet until the next one. Isn't that how it always works? Who knew that JPRGs could sound this raw and funky? Better pop your headphones on to find out."
