title: 'Lying Floaters'
linerNotes: "Produced, mixed and mastered by Simbrula Nox ----- 'A man must dream a long time in order to act with grandeur, and dreaming is nursed in darkness.' ~ Jean Genet This is a culmination of eight months work. Sixteen new tracks developing on the sound from the previous album, Erebos. Sounding a bit pretentious now so enjoy! P.S. - Thanks to everyone who has supported!"
