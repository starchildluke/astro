title: 'MONOLITH'
linerNotes: "MONOLITH is the 5th album from Starchildluke's #Road2Switch series. But this one comes from his second alter-ego, Shrill Evans. It's a sub-20-minute journey through jazz and classical beats from the 18th century all the way to the present day. Shrill Evans' name takes inspiration from Bill Evans, the late jazz pianist who was classically trained at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music in New York. MONOLITH is a nod to him and the music that fuelled his prolific career. The album was produced, mixed, and mastered by Shrill himself, using his trusty SP-303 for added grit. Fans who download the album will get an exclusive bonus track of Shrill Evans live at The Ternhill Grove in Bradford, his one and only performance back in 1995. ‚úù for jazz
* for classical"
