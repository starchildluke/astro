Here is my media log (mlog) for August.

## Movies

I watched 4 movies last month and all but one was with my son.

You can check [my Letterboxd diary on their main site](https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2024/08/) or [my historical diaries on my site](/letterboxd-diaries/) but here's a quick list:

* Despicable Me 4 
* Alien: Romulus
* Kung Fu Panda
* Kung Fu Panda 2

The first two Kung Fu Panda movies were my son's idea after we watched the third one in July. We watched them in reverse order but it didn't matter as they were pretty standard hero-in-peril-saves-the-world movies. Nice animation, nice action.

Alien: Romulus was... not great. As I said on Letterboxd:

<blockquote>
	<p>This film felt underbaked. Also not a fan of the Black "guy" getting abused so often.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I think about how well The Thing portrayed distrust and cabin fever and I'm watching this movie and those themes were treated like difficult problems to solve and this is the best they could come up with. Didn't feel particularly original and it generally pissed me off.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In the words of Peppermint, <q>have I seen it? Girl, I want to <b>un</b>see it.</q>
</blockquote>

But on the plus side, it made me appreciate Prometheus and Covenant more (which isn't saying much).

And finally Despicable Me 4 was really good; better than I expected and it finished with Everybody Wants To Rule The World by Tears for Fears (which we both sung along to ðŸ¥¹)

## Games

### Breath of Fire IV

I've been playing this for the last few weeks and I've really enjoyed so far. I love the isometric view and the pixel art graphics, which make it feel more like a GBA game than a PS1 game but that doesn't diminish its quality. I'm following along with a speedrun video and according to that, I'm about halfway through the game.

### Dragon Quest XI S

Still playing, still enjoying it.

## Videos

### Gronya

Gotta give a shout out to Gronya, a Dragon Quest content creator I've been watching for a while but recently I started watching her streams and joined her Discord. The community is awesome and they've come at an awesome time as I was flagging for the last couple of weeks, mental health wise, and they all came in clutch.

### Wrestling clips

I've been reliving the Attitude Era and some of the later WCW eras before they got bought by WWE. Defining parts of my childhood, even if none of it has aged well. Shout out to [Stone Cold's King of the Ring promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjWPoQWdmjg) and [Scott Steiner shooting on Ric Flair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulpEhmdNhYc) ([twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlJFKLxZxZI)).

## Music

### Ahwlee

Still listening to Ahwlee, for vibes and inspo.

### Ryuichi Sakamoto

Smoochy is my favourite album. So good.

### Late 80s/early 90s smooth jazz

I don't care, I love smooth jazz (not you, Kenny G).

## Books

I read a teensy bit of You Are Here so yay me!
