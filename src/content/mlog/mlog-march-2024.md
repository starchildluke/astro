Here is my media log (mlog) for March.

## Movies

I watched 9 movies last month as a distraction from my generally crap mood for March.

You can check [my Letterboxd diary on their main site](https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2024/03/) or [my historical diaries on my site](/letterboxd-diaries/) but here's a quick list:

* Charlotte's Web
* Happy Death Day
* Happy Death Day 2U
* Street Fighter
* Mortal Kombat
* Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
* Nemesis
* Heat
* My Life

Charlotte's Web was a father-son thing and it was cute and sweet and he enjoyed it. Julia Roberts's voice was so relaxing as Charlotte and Steve Buscemi played a great rat as Templeton.

I revisited the Happy Death Day series for the first time in a while and had a bit of a 90s film bonanza for the rest of the month, starting with Street Fighter (RIP <span lang="es-PR">Raúl Juliá</span>), doing the original Mortal Kombat double for the first time, revisiting Nemesis and Heat, and finally ending with My Life, a poignant movie about life and how we can craft it through a series of misunderstandings but change them at any given moment.

## Games

### Dragon Quest VIII

I wanted to try a DQ game that didn't tie me to the PS4 but also wasn't one of the 16-bit games, and since VIII is so highly regarded, I went for that. I initially tried this on PS2 but the frame rate was so bad on the emulator (even on a Pixel 5), that I went for the 3DS version and it's been great with the voice acting and the mechanics. Again, I don't mind the grind as much especially with speed up and it's not like Pokémon where you don't necessarily need strategy (compared to VGC).

### Dragon Quest XI S

Seeing how good this looked on PS4, I decided to get a PS4 Pro just so I could play it. Yes, it was already on Switch but I don't regret the decision but it looks and plays amazingly and it's a game I'm co-oping with my son which adds a unique element to it all. The voice acting is stellar, I actually enjoy the cut scenes for once, and it's just a gorgeous game so far.

### Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince

I picked this up as a promotion treat and I've loved it so far. It has all the charm of the previous DQM games and the mechanics are so easy to get lost in. I love being able to speed through battles as grinding is a pain in any RPG. I know there are supposed to be frame rate issues later on but I've not reached that part yet and, having played Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for a year and a half, I'll cope!

### Dragon Quest Builders 2

This was supposed to be a game my son and I could play together but he didn't like all the talking so I've played a bit on my own. Not as much as the others but it's been enjoyable. Minecraft meets Dragon Quest, what's not to love?

## Videos

### yr fave film critic

My friend Dom has a podcast series called [yr fave film critic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCowZunJhB7zyFfFupbXsRrhA4a6-k4G) where he talks about film news, what he's watched, and answers viewer/listener questions. It's so good and enjoyable and he has some great recommendations as well (Nemesis being one of them.)

### Law & Order clips

I watched one a few days ago and then YouTube said "here, have some more" and I watched some more! I used to enjoy the show until it got so dark that it wasn't conducive to good mental health. But the clips were good!

## Music

### Ahwlee

Been listening to a lot of his music, for inspiration and just for the vibes. He's one of my favourite producers right now and his album VII is exemplary.

### Zero 7

They're my most listened to group on Last.fm and they actually dropped some new music in April which I love.

## Books

No books again this month. Still bad, I know.
