Here is my media log (mlog) for October.

## Movies

I watched 3 movies last month:

* Clean and Sober
* The Angry Birds Movie 2
* Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

I'd been meaning to watch Clean and Sober for a while, just for my man Michael Keaton and it was really good. It was quite tense in its depictions of addiction and denial before realisation kicks in at the end.

The Angry Birds Movie 2 was better than I thought. Obviously it was an Angry Birds film so not awe-inspiring in any way (and arguably way past its peak) but it was funny in places and serviceable.

Finally, I watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with my son over 3 nights (because he fell asleep each time). It was the Johnny Depp pretends to be Michael Jackson version and again, good and funny if not a bit uncomfortable in places but that's Tim Burton for ya!

## Games

### Shin Pokémon Blue

I'm kinda tired of the "we made Gen 1 better because, in hindsight, it SUCKED but we're gonna pretend like we knew it sucked back in 1998" Pokémon ROM hacks so I decided to go for an enhancement ROM hack that keeps most of the game intact but adds improvements in places and subtle storyline changes that don't completely change the game.

So far, I'm enjoying it and I thought I'd try a Nuzlocke. I'll add my final team on [centiskor.ch](https://centiskor.ch/) if I beat it.

### Super Kirby Clash

I played a little bit of Super Kirby Clash with my son which was fun. It's one of my favourite free-to-play games with non-intrusive microtransactions that you don't need to enjoy it.

## Videos

### Gronya

Another shout out to Gronya, who I started watching a few months ago. She released [a new video about Dragon Quest Heroes II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyt69EZgjww) you should check out if that's your kinda thing.

### House clips

I've watched so many clips of House that I should really start watching the whole series. But I'm gonna hold off until I finish...

### The Mentalist

I started The Mentalist as a way to get through packing before I moved on 31st October. I managed to get through 3 seasons before I moved and it's been fun rewatching it. I'd forgotten some of the episodes and, for me, they didn't age super well but I'm about halfway through and looking forward to getting closer to Red John.

## Music

### Robert Palmer

Last year, I got into Robert Palmer in a big way and I thought I'd listen to him again to mark that "anniversary" so to speak. It was comforting and I'd like to do that some more in November.
