It's been a while.

Here is my mlog for September 2025 (so far).

## Movies

I've watched a lot of Hallmark movies. It's all I can handle at the moment and they're easy to find and watch on YouTube. None of them have been particularly good but you don't watch them for the stellar acting.

You can check [my Letterboxd diary on their main site](https://letterboxd.com/lukealexdavis/films/diary/for/2025/09/) or [my historical diaries on my site](/letterboxd-diaries/) but here's a quick list (in reverse order):

* Falling for You
* One Summer
* Roman J. Israel, Esq.
* A Taste of Love
* Flip That Romance
* Trespass
* Over the Moon
* Light Oneiric
* Baking Up Love
* Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead 

I wish Roman J. Israel, Esq. had been better. Denzel was great but it just felt like a sloppy movie with an annoying ending. Trespass was a movie I'd seen one scene of decades ago and I found it again after looking up what I remember on Google and searching the script for certain words. Classic me. Sadly that movie wasn't great either. Maybe I should watch good movies next.

## Games

### Final Fantasy IX

I've been playing this for the past couple of months and it's my favourite FF to date. However, I'm nearing the end and I'm ready for it to be done and move onto other games, such as...

### Breath of Fire IV

Still haven't finished it. I want to finish it.

### The Plucky Squire

I bought this last night (20th Sep). It's been on my radar since the first trailer and I'm excited to try it this weekend. I'll report back whether it's good or not.

### Watchword

I bought another word game called Word Play which I've enjoyed playing with my son and Watchword has some similar themes but it seems very different. Could this be the gateway to a roguelike fandom?

### Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To

Another game that's been on my Steam wishlist for a while. It's queer, it's colourful, and it has puzzles. I can't wait to start!

## Videos

### Candy videos

I'm currently obsessed with seeing people making peanut brittle. I don't eat it but hearing the mixture his the metal table and getting spread across the surface? So good.

### Suits clips

Remember the lawyer show? Well, I loved it when it was on air and so did my mum. And now I've been watching clips and sending them to her to enjoy. I've also started it again from the beginning and it's so funny seeing everyone with their Season 1 hair and body weight. Zero eye bags though. They had to draw the line somewhere.

### Hyprland rice demos

“What?” I hear you ask. Hyprland is a “tiling Wayland compositor” (in layperson's terms, it manages how windows tile on the screen and it looks super fancy). Rices are like on-screen desktop setup and from the videos I've seen, they all look so cool. I managed to get Arch Linux + Hyprland on my [mini PC](/posts/gamesir-g8-galileo-peladn-wi-6-mini-pc) and it's been good so far. Just need to figure out the controls.

### Dexter YouTube Poops

I've become obsessed with YouTube Poops of the show Dexter, specifically the scene where Doakes finds Dexter in a shipping yard where he's looking for Deb “in a cargo box”. It's Steamed Hams but with swearing and a surprise, motherf\*cker.

### YouTube Poops in general

[DaThings](https://www.youtube.com/@DaThings) is a genius, that's all I'll say.

## Music

### Robert Palmer

Autumn is Palmer season as far as I'm concerned and I'm locked in.

### Ahwlee

When am I not listening to Ahwlee?

### The radio

I listen to Smooth daily. Same songs over and over but my brain is smooth and numb.

## Books

I read a bit of Black Meme and jailbroke my Kindle. That counts as reading, right?
