The people behind [@nyt_first_said](https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said) created [a visual "machine"](https://maxbittker.github.io/clear-pipes/) of how they find the unique words they tweet.

>Each day, a script scrapes new articles from nytimes.com. That text is tokenized, or split into words based on whitespace and punctuation.
>Each word then must pass several criteria. Containing a number or special character is criteria for disqualification. To avoid proper nouns, all capitalized words are filtered.
>The most important check is against the New York Time's archive search service. The archive goes back to 1851 and contains more than 13 million articles.
>The paper publishes many thousands of words each day, but only a very few are firsts.

I like these kinds of Twitter accounts, finding genuinely unique content.
