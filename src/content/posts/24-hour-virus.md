For the first time in a year, I got sick. It started with a sneeze on Thursday, then turned into a phlegmy throat, and it descended from there.

It has totally wiped me out. On the plus side, I've been able to catch up on my YouTube Watch Later playlist.

I'm currently struggling to get to sleep. My body aches but my mind is wired. A metaphysical dilemma. But I'd prefer to be in a better physical state. (See what I did there?)
