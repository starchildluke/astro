I don't get it. I guess, by that, I'm not their target audience anyway but the technology seems superfluous to me.

Why not improve mobile infrastructure? I'm sick of phone lag, via regular calls and VOIP.

What about sustainable battery life so they don't go to crap in a year when most people are halfway through their contracts?

Or a better alternative to Bluetooth?

Give me any of those things over a foldable phone.
