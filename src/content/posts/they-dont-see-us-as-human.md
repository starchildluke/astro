They use our culture as commodities, costumes, rhetorical devices, proofs in arguments, justification of self, and weapons to kill, maim, and ruin. And when we die, they call it sacrifice or justified, whichever fits their narrative. These actions mean they don't see us as human at any point in our lives and that hurts and we have to live our lives trying to avoid these people as much as possible. Our lives are not for them to use. George Floyd's death was not a sacrifice that rich white liberals should thank him for.

Keep your abhorrent rhetoric to yourself.
