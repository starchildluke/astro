Hey, it's me&mdash;tired yet again.

I saw a tweet today that said it takes years to get over burnout and I'm into my third year of it. I'm on my hundredth Twitter break. I'm easily overwhelmed by EVERYTHING in [SEO](/jardim/tech/seo/) right now. There seems to be a million and one ways to do the same things and the million and first is somehow the better version. I seem to get sensory overload a lot easier these days. I'm more irritable than I've ever been. I have an appetite for food but none for making it. I'm too tired to do anything extra-curricular other than blog. I constantly feel like I'm running on empty.

Just an FYI (but not an invitation for suggestions on how to fix me.)
