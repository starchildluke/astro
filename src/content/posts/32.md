It was my 32nd birthday on Monday. I spent it with my parents in Nice and really enjoyed it. I ate nice food, got some new clothes, relaxed, and allowed myself to bask in the gratitude and comfort of being able to visit them and not worry about anyone or anything else.

My birthday last year wasn't what I'd hoped because of the pandemic and while that's still here (ICYMI), I was lucky to travel abroad and not get [COVID-19](/posts/covid-19/) at any point before, during, or after (thank you vaccine, masks, and social distancing!) It was the kind of birthday I've grown accustomed to in my late 20s/early 30s - spending it outside the hellhole that is the United Kingdom, either alone in [Lisbon in 2017](/posts/my-week-in-lisbon/) and 2018 or with my parents in Nice in 2019.

Let's see what happens in 2022!
