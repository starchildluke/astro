<Lede>I forgot that I did this for 2024</Lede> so here's my media of the year for 2025! The only difference is that I'm going to pick two for each category: one from 2025 and one not from 2025 that I consumed last year (unless they're both the same!)

## Film of the year

### 2025: KPop Demon Hunters

I only watched 6 new movies last year and honestly, I would have struggled to pick a winner had KPop Demon Hunters not been amongst them. It was such a good movie with plenty of the hallmarks of a global phenomenon. I'm looking forward to what the burgeoning franchise has to offer next.

### Not 2025: Training Day/Tombstone

I wasn't sure which to pick as the best not-new movie I'd watched last year so I chose two. Training Day was stellar and Denzel acted his arse off (IYKYK). I swear his performance changed my brain chemistry for about a week after watching it. No one has deserved an Oscar more than he did for that role.

Tombstone was long overdue despite not knowing much about it beyond it being a "modern" Western. For everyone who said it was the greatest western of all time, I'm right there with you. It's sad that Val Kilmer's passing brought me towards it but I'm glad I watched it because his performance deserved an Oscar just like Denzel's... except Val didn't get one _of any kind_. When you watch it, you'll be disgusted too. So many quotables. Great movie.

## Game of the year

### 2025: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33/Pokémon Legends: Z-A

This looks like "one of these things is not like the other" and you'd be right but hear me out. I only played two new games in 2025 and only finished one which was Pokémon Legends: Z-A. But in terms of an overall better game, the few hours that I played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 I really enjoyed.

I've not gone back to Clair Obscur for a while due to my backlog but I certainly will. As for Z-A, I enjoyed the base game and DLC but it ran out of steam fairly quickly. Maybe I shouldn't have gone full pelt from October to December but I like to immerse myself in a new Pokémon game and did everything I wanted to in 8 weeks which sounds ridiculous considering I got 3 years out of Scarlet/Violet + two DLCs.

### Not 2025: Final Fantasy IX

I wrote about it in my [completed games of 2025 blog post](/posts/16-games-completed-2025/#1-final-fantasy-ix-ps1) but here's a snippet:

> What a game [...] the story drew me in from the get-go, the dialogue was mature and whimsical [...] and gameplay was the peak of pre-3D FF combat with the ATB system

## Book of the year

### 2025: "Solidarity with Children – An Essay Against Adult Supremacy" by Madeline Lane-McKinley

\*sigh\* another thing I didn't finish but enjoyed a lot. "Solidarity with Children" digs into the way children are often ignored and mistreated from a societal perspective and offers ways to remedy that. I felt myself recollecting not only my own childhood but my parenting over the last 10 years and I hope to work through the rest of the book and practice what it preached.

## Series of the year

### Not 2025: Monster Rancher

A real throwback. I watched this anime when I was a kid but never finished it. In fact, I thought the episode I watched was the end but it was just the end of the _first season_. I watched it from start to finish before Christmas and finished it yesterday but I'm counting it for 2025. Really fun, whimisical, and so heartfelt. It took a lot of cues from the Pokémon anime but went down a different path so it could stand out; just about.

## Streamer of the year: Chazingdra

It's been great watching Chazingdra's channel continue to grow and all the cool new Pokémon challenges he took on in 2025. More to come and I can't wait to see it.

**Honourable mention**: Possum Oakwood

## Album of the year

### 2025: Kaytranada – AIN'T NO DAMN WAY!

When Kaytranada drops something, you drop everything and listen. AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! was something of a surprise given he'd just released an album the year before (which was also a banger). I keep saying this but his unbeaten streak needs to be studied because everything he's ever released has been perfect. No skips whatsoever. It's been over a DECADE.

**Honourable mentions**: Vulfpeck – Clarity of Cal and Σtella – Adagio

## Performance of the year: Wolfe Glick winning EUIC

Phenomenal performance with that iconic speech and the shock announcement at the end. Beyond goated.
