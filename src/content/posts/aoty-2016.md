I started a tradition of posting my AOTY list at the end of January the following year to be different and left some of them marinate in my mind. There's always a rush to get the lists out and there's really no need.

I've added a new feature this year by splitting all the albums I've listened to into three categories - ðŸ˜€, ðŸ˜• and ðŸ¥´. ðŸ˜€ albums are the ones I enjoyed, ðŸ˜• are the ones I didn't and ðŸ¥´ are the ones I wasn't 100% sure about.

(Oh, and they're not in order. I've stopped doing that too.)
