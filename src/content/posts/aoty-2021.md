In 2021, I listened to 203 albums which broke my previous record of 200, set in 2020. I changed up how I ranked them by using the [Pokémon Smogon rule system](https://www.smogon.com/sm/articles/sm_tiers):

- Ubers - The best
- OU (Overused) - Good albums
- UU (Underused) - Okay albums but missing *something*
- RU (Rarely used) - Passable but missing more
- NU (Never used) - Not good
- PU (as in... you get it) - Awful

Below is a list of the albums I ranked in the Ubers tier with the top 3 in order:
