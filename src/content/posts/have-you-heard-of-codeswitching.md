Still reading through kottke.org's archives and found this [2003 post on "bilingual conversations"](https://kottke.org/03/09/bilingual-conversations)

It was funny to read in retrospect because:

1. It's from 2003 which isn't _that_ far away but it feels that way if you read this
2. It pretty much says "hey, I found out about this thing called 'codeswitching'. Have you heard of it?"
3. It's something minorities do to get some privacy and peace and has been going on for centuries ([thanks slavery and oppression!](https://wamu.org/story/18/09/12/ready-for-a-linguistic-controversy-say-mhmm/))
4. How it became a "thing" to media publications in the 2010s

I've codeswitched in different ways since I was 6. I had to adopt a different accent to stop kids asking me to say words in my Northern accent. I kept it up for about 15 years with only a couple of slips and explanations when they heard me. I did it when I lived in Atlanta for the same reason. I do it with my mum, switching between Jamaican and English, as does she. It puts a point across better when you do it and it's the closest I'll get to [calling myself a polyglot](https://cultrface.co.uk/2-polyglots-have-an-awesome-chat-in-21-languages/).
