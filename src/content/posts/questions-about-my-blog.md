Decided to do this after [anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2025/questions-about-the-blog/) did it so thanks for the non-specific tag!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I've loved the internet since I first accessed it in the late 90s and I've been making websites for that long. I've always had something to say about my favourite things and when I discovered blogging in 2008, I jumped on the bandwagon. As a teenager, I had a lot to say and rant about because I felt everything so passionately. I still have that passion but only for specific things and much less than I used to. Now, most of my writing comes in the form of shitposts on social media and the more serious stuff goes here.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I use WordPress for most of my blogs and [Astro](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/how-astro-changed-my-web-life/) for this one. WordPress is easier for larger sites and Astro is the latest static site generator I've used for my personal site. Previously, I've used [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), WordPress, and I handcoded the site in the early days. I chose Astro because it was easy to use, intuitive, and meant I could use as much or as little JavaScript as I needed without learning any other languages.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

On this site, I just use Sublime Text and write it out manually. I've been trying [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) lately but I'm still getting to grips with it. Baby steps.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

When I think I have something to say or feel really strongly about something. I have a content workflow where I save interesting links and post about them on my other blogs while here, things are more personal and often longform so they're not as frequent.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I mostly write and publish but if it needs time, I let it simmer.

## What’s your favourite post on your blog?

[Last Donut of the Night: when Federer & Dilla united for a weekend](/posts/last-donut-of-the-night-when-federer-dilla-united-for-1-weekend/), [Being Black in digital marketing in 2023](/posts/being-black-in-digital-marketing-2023/), [Some caveats to SEO and web performance](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/some-caveats-to-seo-and-web-perf/), and [Probably Autistic](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/probably-autistic/)

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

[I've recently updated the look](/posts/updated-website-again/) with a new headings font and centralising the header nav. But I'm always looking for ways to improve the site so watch this space.

## Who’s next?

If you read this and have a blog, I nominate you to answer these questions.
