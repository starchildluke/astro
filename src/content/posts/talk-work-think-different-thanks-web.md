[We talk, work, and think different thanks to the web](https://web.archive.org/web/20230329050946/https://capiche.com/e/web-browser-history), says Matthew Guay in an article about how web browsers reinvented everything. It's funny because I was watching [Halt and Catch Fire](https://logicface.co.uk/tag/halt-and-catch-fire/) last night and [Joe McMillan's speech about the power of browsers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi_fKu9WTAE) really touched me.

Thank you Netscape, Mosaic, Opera, Internet Explorer (before your flaws got so bad), Tor, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome (even though you're a RAM and CPU hog).
