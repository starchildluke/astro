Why are people acting like she's the first Black person to be part of an election campaign or run for office or whatever? She's still a cop and for all those people calling for defunding and abolition of police cheering for her, what's happening? I will always support Black women as long as I know they'll support me and people like me. Skin folk ain't always kin folk etc. And people have rightfully called out this cognitive dissonance (namely Black people) and been called out by White folks for being divisive. Are you for real?

I was reluctant to say anything but the hype is pissing me off. When the shit hits the fan, we'll see how those opinions change.
