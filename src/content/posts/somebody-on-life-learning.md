<p>Allegedly, Maya Angelou said this but it's disputed and given her history with misattributed quotes, I'm inclined to think she <em>didn't</em> say this. But that doesn't stop it from being interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I’ve learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights."</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought about how I would react in those situations and it does say a lot about me: calm except when I'm incredibly anxious because someone asked me to do something specific in those situations.</p>
