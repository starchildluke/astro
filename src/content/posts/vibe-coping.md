There’s a new kind of coping I call “vibe coping”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace existential crises, and forget that the world even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs are getting too powerful. Also I just talk to myself so I barely even touch grass.

I ask God for the wildest things like “give me more money” because I’m too lazy to sell stuff on eBay. I pray occasionally, I don’t read the Bible anymore. When I get ignored I just pray some more, usually that does nothing. The copium grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really vibe through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix me so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.

It’s not too bad for momentary spirals, but still quite amusing. I’m building [Marimo apps](/morsels/morsel-16/), but it’s not really coping—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and pray for stuff, and it mostly does nothing.

<small>(This is a very silly parody of [Andrej Karpathy's tweet about vibe coding](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) which I have adapted for this sh!tpost. It's not a dig at him or what he said, more a dig at me and my current mental health.)</small>
