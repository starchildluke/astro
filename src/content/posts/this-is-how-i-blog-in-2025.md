In 2020, I outlined [my content creation flow](/posts/this-is-my-content-creation-flow/) and even got a chance to do a talk about it. But things have changed since then and I no longer use some services so I thought I'd update my blogging flow for 2025.

## Tools of the trade

The things I use are now:

* [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)
* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)
* [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/)
* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/)
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)

There are quite a few differences. I stopped using Feedly a few years ago and replaced it with Inoreader. It works pretty much the same way but the Pro account is cheaper if I want it. Instapaper replaces Pocket (RIP) and that arguably works better. I stopped using Buffer too as it was a waste of money considering I also stopped using Twitter and honestly didn't want to pay $10 a month for Bluesky scheduling. And I also took the Python script out as it didn't add any benefits in the end.

## The process

The tools have changed but the process is relatively the same:

1. I find interesting content on the Web, either on social media, YouTube, or Inoreader
2. If it piques my interest, I save it on Instapaper for later or I check it out there and then
3. If I want to write about it, I add it to a corresponding Raindrop folder based on my blog categories
4. If I don't want to write about it but I want to keep it for reference, I add it as a bookmark in Pinboard
5. When I'm ready to blog, I go from oldest to newest unless the idea is time-sensitive
6. I use Wordpress as the CMS for my main blogs and Astro for this site
7. I publish and post it on socials manually

## Conclusion

This flow continues to work for me years later. I'm also doing a lot better with clearing backlogs on all platforms that I save ideas.
