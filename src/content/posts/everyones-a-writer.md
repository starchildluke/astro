As long as you have intent, it doesn't matter whether your scribbles are intelligible or not—you are a writer.

Don't be fooled by capitalist traditions. People who write books aren't the only writers in the world. Everyone is a writer but not everyone is a novelist, or a journalist, a blogger, a calligraphist, a student, a researcher, a data entry clerk, a typographer, or a teacher. When you add specificity, that's when you can exclude yourself.

Writing is for all.
