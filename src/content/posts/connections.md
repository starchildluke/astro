There's a road closed on one of the bus routes I take a few times a week. It's meant that I go down a route that's closer to my house than the original path. The downside is I still have to walk for 20-30 minutes to get home and that made me think of how cities aren't always as connected as they should be. Where I live isn't out in the sticks and neither is the detour I've had to take. Why isn't there a better connection between the two?
