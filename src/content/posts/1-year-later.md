I'll be brief.

It's been a year since the death of [George Floyd](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-death-of-george-floyd-in-context). It was a watershed moment for a lot of people when it could have been avoided. I'm still tired, still angry, still suspicious, and still reeling from the last year. I allowed myself to think changes could be made but white people let me down. Again. And while [Black communities](/jardim/black/) have responded and shifted and fought hard in that time which has helped me and many other, nothing has really changed besides [some names on food packaging](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aunt-jemima-brand-will-change-name-remove-image-quaker-says-n1231260). I've seen so-called allies get his name wrong on videos, buy books to "do the reading", give them away without starting them, make snide comments about "not being woke enough", complain of "[ally fatigue](http://blackyouthproject.com/allyship-fatigue-is-an-insult-to-black-folks-who-never-get-to-rest/)", [post black squares](https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/blackout-tuesday-guide.html) only to take them down because they messed up the grid, people remain silent despite their presence and influence within Black cultures. It's been a lot.

It makes it look like George Floyd died so Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima could retire from their advertising duties and got a "thanks, bro" from Nancy Pelosi. _How sweet!_

Black Lives Still Matter and fuck the police.
