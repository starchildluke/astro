This post was a little different when I wrote it on my phone. Then I couldn't save it, thought I'd copied everything and when I reloaded the page, somehow only got one paragraph.

So now you have this. It's still about [Bad Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4h9xcdtyrE) - which I watched tonight and enjoyed for the 10th time - but not in the same way. Whatever.

[I logged it in Letterboxd](/letterboxd-diaries/#2020) and noticed there have been multiple films made called Bad Boys.

* [Bad Boys (1961)](https://www.filmaffinity.com/us/film372179.html) - A [Japanese](/jardim/japan/) film about "a young delinquent who takes part in a robbery and is sentenced to a juvenile detention centre, where he clashes with other youths and reflects on his life experiences".
* [Bad Boys (1983)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRILgwNJNkI) - A similar film (is it a Western remake?) about a delinquent sent to a juvenile detention centre starring Sean Penn, Clancy Brown, and Ally Sheedy
* Bad Boys (2003) - A Finnish "true story" with four topless white men on the cover
* Bad Boys (2014) - A documentary about the [Detroit Pistons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFa4BChz5w)

I might watch the one about the Detroit Pistons. Probably gonna skip the Finnish one.
