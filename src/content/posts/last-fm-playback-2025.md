I kicked Spotify to the curb after their continuous support of warfare, AI, and white supremacy (better late than never I guess since it was nothing new). I've since moved to TIDAL but I did that in the middle of the year so my stats weren't consistent. That left Last.fm for my yearly review and it's been my ever-faithful since waaay back.

(tl;dr: [here's the full Last.fm report for 2025](https://www.last.fm/user/alex_ferguson/listening-report/year/2025) if you'd rather just read what they put together.)

## In 2025, I spent 30 days, 15 hours listening to music

Apparently, that's enough to fill 490 cassette tapes and fly to the moon 9 times.

## My top artist was...

**Ahwlee**!

I scrobbled him **1,516 times**, putting me in the **top 0.02% of fans worldwide** (I'm gonna pretend that's a rounding error because that's a lot in one year so who the hell listened more than that???)

I also explored **1,524** artists in 2025, and discovered **44%** of them for the first time.
