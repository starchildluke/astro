In 2017, I made a list of inspiring creatives. A lot has happened since then and I wanted to make a list of some more. Creative doesn't necessarily mean the arts; as my dad used to say <q>life and survival are creative as well.</q> So this will be a mix of people who have instilled creativity in my life and work.

## 1. Vincent Warmerdam

Vincent is a developer and he has really changed my outlook on how I code and how I build things with more simplicity and curiosity, especially from the perspective of data and the insights we can get from it. A lot of tutorials and guides focus on getting from A to B in the "right" way but his videos have switched my thought processes to the journey and all the tangents we can go off on along the way.

## 2. Sean Seanson

Sean is a YouTuber and content creator with a channel focused on PS1 era media. I can't remember how I found him but I've watched his PS1 game developer round-ups so many times and they never get old. Between the aesthetics, the humour, and the cool vibes (seriously, there's no ragebait or trolling here, just vibes and games), you should check out his channel and throw him some coins on Patreon if you like what you see.

## 3. Anh aka anhvn

Anh is a web designer, artist, and blogger and her website designs are honestly goals. They may change regularly but that part resonates with me as I've changed this site so many times over the years. But no matter what the reason or inspiration, the results alawys look so good and I like her candid posts about those transitions and the media she consumes. It's real and aesthetically pleasing and that's what the epitome of the Web to me.

## 4. Josh Rivers

I had the pleasure of meeting Josh at a Black History Month event many years ago and although that was the only meeting to date, it stuck with me because it was one of the first times that I felt heard when I spoke. Since then, I have watched Josh grow both from a professional perspective as well as a personal and spiritual point of view. Nobody I know consumes, formulates, and relays information like Josh and his award-winning podcast Busy Being Black is essential listening for anyone wishing to broaden their horizons and see the world around from queer Black perspectives.

## 5. Jacky AlcinÃ©

Jacky is a software engineer and a vital person in the tech sphere because of his focus on civic and government technologies. He wants the world to be better and I fully stand by that. He's also funny and knows his shit. In the darkest hours, we need more perspectives and views like Jacky's to make sense of things and maybe find a better way out.

## 6. jamie aka seafare

When I started making [centiskor.ch](centiskor.ch), I looked for inspiration and found most of it with a site called seafare. It's run by jamie whose aesthetic is honestly ðŸ˜™ðŸ‘Œ and I love checking the site every so often for updates and see the new things they've done. I know I've used the word vibes a few times in this post already but seriously... such good vibes. Relaxing and enjoyable, it's gets me excited to play PokÃ©mon or take on a new challenge.
