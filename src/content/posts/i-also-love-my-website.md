I discovered [anhvn.com](https://anhvn.com/), the personal site of Anh, a designer and artist based in Canada and I love it. Then I found one of her blog posts called ["I love my website"](https://anhvn.com/posts/2021/2021-12-14-i-love-my-website/) which was part of a chain following similar posts by <a href="https://winnielim.org/notes/i-love-my-website-too/">Winnie Lim</a>, <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2021/11/19/personal-websites-are-the-best/">Tracy Durnell</a>, <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2021/11/16/i-love-my-website/">James</a>, and <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/10887">Jeremy Keith</a>.

So I'm here to jump on that bandwagon&mdash;I also love my website. This is like the 10th or 11th iteration of my personal website and this one is my favourite. It's still not *quite* as streamlined as I'd like it but it's just good enough to leave alone without expecting it to fall apart. Sure, Google likes to deindex a lot of my pages (which irks me as a full-time technical SEO) but it's all real and personal to me and that's precisely what you want from a **personal** website.

That said, now that I've seen Anh's "redesigning in public", I'm getting a teeny tiny itch to make some tweaks of my own. I can never sit still for *too* long when it comes to personal web design.
