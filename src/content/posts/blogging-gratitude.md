I'm very protective over the art of [blogging](/jardim/blogging/) because, without it, I would absolutely not be where I am today. No way.

And that's despite (6) years of doubt over the purpose of it all. But I made significant connections that got me into a line of work that met my needs and I've been able to flourish on my own terms, which I'm immensely grateful for.

Blogging in its most perceived form isn't what it used to be (now more affiliate/commercial vs. journaling/niche community writing, although the latter never died) but it's by no means dead.

The one recommendation I always make when asked how to get into digital marketing is [get a website](/posts/get-a-website/). A blog is an easy way to do that (remember a blog is just a website). It's not about "no one will read it". Most won't. But it should primarily be for you as it has been for me.

I write whatever the hell I want without thought for search volumes and that's why ranking for anything is amazing to me. But it has wider implications. You can express yourself, learn, make mistakes, and refine. Helpful if you don't feel comfortable talking to people IRL.
