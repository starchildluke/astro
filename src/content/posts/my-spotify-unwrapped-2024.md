Today is Spotify Unwrapped day so, rather than just posting the images in a social media thread, I'd write a blog and not deal with the character limit.

## Minutes listened

<p>I can't remember how many minutes I listened on Spotify last year but it was probably more. After listening to 730 albums in 2023, I needed a break from constant music listening so I focused on what I loved and the new stuff I was excited about. You'll see that in the next images. I have no idea what I was listening to on 17th January either but it must have been good.</p>


## My 2024 Music Evolution

January set the tone for the rest of the year but "chill beats lo-fi" doesn't quite do it justice. Wun Two, Ahwlee, and Walterwarm don't make those kind of mediocre, heavily compressed, piano-driven slow beats you hear seemingly everywhere. There's real artistry in their production and that's why I listen to them so much.

February kept the vibe going, adding Dilla and Knxwledge to the mix; legends of their craft.

Then May went in a completely different direction thanks to Justice's new album, _Hyperdrama_. Boy, was I obsessed! And of course, Daft Punk, Modjo, and Alan Braxe followed.

## Top song and artist

Yep, this checks out. I LOVED _Hyperdrama_ and had it regularly on repeat from when the singles dropped earlier in the year all the way through to June. I missed them a lot and with the Olympics being held in Paris as well, it felt like a very French 2024 from a cultural perspective.

As for my top artist, those 1,516 minutes aren't even close to how much I _really_ listened to Ahwlee on all platforms. I'm a huge fan of his work and the album that featured the most amongst those minutes was his Final Fantasy 7 album, _VII_. It's a comfort album and a sampling masterpiece. The arrangements are off the chart and heavily influenced my [NOQUEST](/music/noquest/) series.

The rest is history. Justice carried me through the first half of the year, with Gabriel Garzón-Montano peppered throughout 2024 with his infectious single, _MARMALADE_ (it's a good song to brush your teeth to, btw!)

For the top artists, I've spoken about Ahwlee and Justice already but it's nice to the other 3 still in my top 5 from last year. I'm always going to listen to Zero 7 over and over. Wun Two is so easy to just put on and let him run with really smooth loops. And Seal, my man! I listened to a lot of his music while shiny hunting in Pokémon Violet (particularly for shiny Forretress).

And that's it! Nothing out of the ordinary and a perfect representation of what I listen to.
