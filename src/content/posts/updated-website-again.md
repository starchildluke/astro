You may or may not have noticed that I've updated the site design a little. The first thing that's changed is the header where I've switched the top-line nav for a centralised nav. I got bored of the top-line and reduce the number of nav links so it was smaller.

And the headings font is different. [Erode](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/erode) was nice but I wanted something as close to [Tiempos Text](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) as I could get that was 1) free and 2) small in file size as not to impact performance. In the end, I opted for a Google font of all things and [DM Serif Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display) was the answer (via some subsetting).

I've added a separator on the homepage made with SVGs of Pok√© Balls and the top songs section has been modernised with some fancy CSS. And the Misc page has returned. I think that's about it so far.
