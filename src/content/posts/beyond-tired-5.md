Hey, it's me&mdash;tired again.

This past week has been hell, mentally. And while I'm feeling marginally better, I'm now exhausted. Had a big rant on Instagram about psychiatry and how we all shout about getting therapy but it can't solve everything and it shouldn't be used as a default resolution for every problem we have.

Do I need it? Yes.

Do I need it for the crap that's thrown me off this week? No.
