[marimo](https://marimo.io/) is a new type of reactive notebook for Python which builds on the work you might have seen in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and combines them into an interesting package.

As the site says, it's reproducible, integrates with popular progamming tools like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and SQL (which is built-in), and can either be used as a regular Python script or transformed into an interactive app whilst maintaining the code in the background.

Just as an FYI: I'm not sponsored or affiliated with marimo, I just love what I've seen so far and wanted to share it here. I've already started building some apps with it and they've come in very handy. I'm looking to refactor some other existing Jupyter Notebooks and Streamlit apps into marimo for ease of use, improve reactivity, and better real-time feedback so watch this space.
