I saw a post talking about a jokey meta tag and remembered that you can add any kind of meta tag to your site if you want. It won't be recognised by any search engine but it won't break your site either.

So I've added my own to this site:

```html
<meta name="values" content="Free Palestine, Black Lives Matter, and Trans Lives Matter" />
```

The idea is to show what I stand for in the code itself (besides the Palestine flag at the bottom of my page). And it makes sense to have it in the head.

I wondered if other people joined in whether I could create a directory of sites for it. Feel free to email or message me if you're interested. All you'd need to do is add the code above but replace the content value with your own values. I'd do it via GitHub and you'd have to submit a PR for me to approve (so nothing shitty gets in).
