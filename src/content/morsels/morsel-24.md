Today, I found out about a learning programme called [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/). Created by [Trey Hunner](https://treyhunner.com/), Python Morsels allows people to improve their Python skills for 30 minutes each week with a series of exercises to work through and screencasts to watch.

When I started my own "morsels" as a way to share random Web/coding things I'd made or learnt, I had no idea about this project but it was nice to find it.
