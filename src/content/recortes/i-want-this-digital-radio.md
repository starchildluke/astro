[The Revo SuperSystem](https://www.revoaudio.co.uk/supersystem-walnut-black/) is a DAB+ digital radio, with FM analog radio, Internet radio functionality, Bluetooth, and it supports wireless audio streaming. That kind of technology is commonplace in high-end devices now but The Revo SuperSystem looks so good. It's the walnut finish for me; clean and modernist. I actually saw this in The Equalizer 2 as Denzel Washington's character had one in his apartment. Anything Denzel owns must be good.

It's sold out on the official website but I did manage to find one [on another site](https://www.analogueseduction.net/all-in-one-systems/revo-supersystem-bluetoothdabfminternet-radio.html)... except it's Â£629.00. Yikes. I love it but not enough to bankrupt myself, especial when I already have an internet radio. I'm a magpie for good looking tech, what can I say?
