I found myself getting some Portuguese words mixed up the other day: <span lang="pt">folha</span>, <span lang="pt">pilha</span>, <span lang="pt">filho</span>. They all mean completely different things and realising how close they were (from a NLP perspective), I decided to look up some other words that had lh in the middle. I used a JSON file of common Portuguese words and only picked out 5-letter nouns:

<ul>
	<li><span lang="pt">bilha</span> - a jug</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">filha</span> - daughter</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">filho</span> - son</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">milha</span> - a Portuguese mile (not the same as an imperial mile)</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">milho</span> - maize</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">pilha</span> - battery</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">bolha</span> - bubble</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">folha</span> - leaf</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">folho</span> - a frill or ruffle of fabric</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">molho</span> - sauce</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">rolha</span> - cork</li>
	<li><span lang="pt">solha</span> - flatfish</li>
</ul>

And now for some silly sentences that nobody would ever say:

<span lang="pt">Minha bilha do molho milho da filha</span> - My daughter's corn sauce jug

<span lang="pt">Minha solha do filho engoliu uma rolha e uma folha</span> - My son's flatfish swallowed a cork and a leaf
