so much of the internet is focused on social media sites, on our desktops and phones. but to go to a website that isn't trying to sell you something and browse freely feels like a break away from it all. at least to me.

i've tried to build this site with that in mind (even though i didn't have these words to describe it). i hope it feels that way to anyone reading.
