## Gabriel Garzón-Montano – MARMALADE

> Smile to the pain, smile to the pain / Coke and champagne, sugarcane / Sugarcane, why you do me that way? / Polyurethane, doin' my dance in the rain, once again / Might not ever feel the same

## Seal – Whirlpool

> Life is hard in a circle / Especially when you think you're going insane / And all you get for love is lots of pain / I should have known better
