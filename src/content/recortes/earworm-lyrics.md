## Gabriel Garzón-Montano – MARMALADE

> Smile to the pain, smile to the pain / Coke and champagne, sugarcane / Sugarcane, why you do me that way? / Polyurethane, doin' my dance in the rain, once again / Might not ever feel the same

## Seal – Whirlpool

> Life is hard in a circle / Especially when you think you're going insane / And all you get for love is lots of pain / I should have known better

## SiR – D'Evils

> Tell me who that nigga if it ain't me / If it ain't a party then it's finna be / Never had a problem that I could solve / It must be official if I get involved
