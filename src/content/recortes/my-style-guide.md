A few months ago, I republished a [web copy style guide](/recortes/web-copy-style/) by Matt Pfeffer and enjoyed it. Then, a few days ago, I found [a style guide by Chase McCoy](https://chasem.co/notes/style-guide/) which I also liked. So I decided to write my own.

Much like Chase's, mine will be a work-in-progress and I will inevitably go against my rules. But it's the thought that counts, right?

## Grammar

* Titles always in sentence case unless for an aesthetic reason or for comedic effect
* Punctuation on the inside of a quote ("because the other way feels icky").
* Oxford commas for now, forever, and always
* Em dashes shouldn't have the space either side of them—okay?!
* En Dashes are for numerical ranges such as dates or times and that's a rule I'll always keep from Day 1–365
* Companies/brands are singular, not plural. "Google is a company" rather than "Google are a company"

## Hyperlinking

* From now on, I will avoid using [long text sentences as anchor text as it isn't optimised or helpful for the user](#)
	* Instead, I will use shorter phrases or just the main entity.
* I will also avoid linking to entities purely for internal linking purposes that offer little relevance to the text. For example, if I write about cats and I mention something about computers briefly, I won't link "computers" to my [tech page](/jardim/tech/) (but I've linked it just now because it's relevant to the point).
