<Lede>LLM evangelists find discomfort in comfort and being at peace with enough.</Lede> they have lionised the perverse and glorified the inhumane for heights they will ultimately never reach. sadly they have safety nets that the rest of us could never afford and we're caught in the middle of this process.

and the thing is, a large number of them have the domain experience required to diagnose any LLM issues that arise. most people who use them regularly don't so they're just trusting what comes out until it doesn't work and then they ask it what happened. that part is always left out in their sermons

a lot of them also don't seem to like coding because what if they just put the boilerplate in a function or package earlier? i thought they were really smart and highly proficient where we weren't? jury's still out on that one i guess

if they could ever give me compelling and unique arguments grounded in logic and compassion for humanity (with references to non-faulty poltiics), maybe i'd listen. but alas we just get diluted and directionless fascist-leaning ideals ("leaning" is being VERY kind here).
