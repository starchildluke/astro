the web is built on the backs of weird web shit. all the overly polished saccharine BS we have now is purposely made as an anthesis of the rough draft aesthetic that was popular in the 90s.

and while i don't believe the weird stuff ever died, this renaissance is being co-opted by people who want it re-imagined in their image. make digital gardens like i tell you, create websites like i tell you, create components like i make them, blog like i tell you. fuck that.
