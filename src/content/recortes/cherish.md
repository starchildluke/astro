Whoever or whatever you love, cherish them. Scream about them to anyone and everyone. Indulge in them, absorb them, get obsessed (in moderation), and enjoy them all. Make sure those proverbial flowers are ready to be given at all times.

Love them with every atom of your heart and experience them to the full. Because once you're both gone, you can't do it again.
