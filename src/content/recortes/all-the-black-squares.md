what if i made a tapestry  
out of all the black squares  
adorn my wall with it  
as rememberance of death; a void  
where love and compassion should have been  

what if i made a quilt  
out of all the black squares  
cover my bed with it  
as a means to sleep, in the knowledge  
that i remain cold and unprotected  

what if i made a carpet  
out of all the black squares  
tile my floor with them  
as a way to navigate the hollow rooms  
where community should have been  

what if i made a grid  
out of all the black squares  
improve my instagram with them  
as a way to look like i care  
as long as everything  
stayed in perfect harmony
