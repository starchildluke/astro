From a [Brewers' fan forum](https://brewerfanatic.com/forums/topic/7164-six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon/page/2/#comment-23095) in 2007:

* Saddam Hussein was in a documentary film called Les Dix (2003) with Nelson Mandela
* Nelson Mandela was in Malcolm X (1992) with Matt Dillon
* Matt Dillon  was in Loverboy (2005) with Kevin Bacon

Woah.
