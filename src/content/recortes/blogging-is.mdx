<Lede>people struggle to start blogging.</Lede> there are so many internal and external barriers to entry to put the work out. so if you're advocating for more writers and more bloggers, don't put anymore hurdles in their way.

blogging is this, blogging is that. this is a blog, this isn't a blog. if someone has an idea of what blogging is and reads all these different ideologies, they might find that nothing matches up with their idea and then not bother. that's what we want to avoid.

so if you're reading this and you think blogging is having something meaningful to say, with depth and lots of ideas and references but you have an idea that you can't flesh out in that vision... i'm here to say that's okay. [write it anyway](/posts/everyones-a-writer/). posting a draft that you progressively enhance isn't going to stop the world from turning. it's not going to get you banned from the grand blogging council. you can just write and post and revise if you want.

the sooner we break down the barriers, the better we'll have it. food for thought is one thing but you gotta eat eventually.
