In the face of fascism, we need to do all we can to break those systems and build peace and unity for the oppressed to live their lives without fear or death and dehumanisation. But so often, it feels like the focus is on the anti-fascism work itself. I wonder if the definition of virtue signalling has been lost (much like "woke") but I guess this is the best way to describe it.

It's very telling that the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom hasn't met with any Muslim leaders since the fascist riots started last week. All we've got are prison sentences (which people have applauded, uncritically) when prisons are supposed to be over-capacity, bringing out armies, and only one meeting on Thursday with Muslim community leaders. I'd expect nothing less from a prosector.

I'm just tired of the wrong things taking centre stage and I'm sending love, peace, strength, and guidance to all the Black and brown people affected by recent events and ongoing, because this isn't a singular moment that'll just go away.
