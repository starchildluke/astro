I know things about myself like my values and my strengths, what I like and dislike but I couldn't tell you what kind of personality I have if I even have one or whether I'm just a chameleon copying everyone else's. I'm amongst people and never truly feel like I fit in or that I can relate to most people. And that sucks.
