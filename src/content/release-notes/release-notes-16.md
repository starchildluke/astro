There should be new normals for all of us that take into account the lives and needs of marginalised people and the various axes of power and privilege. We set boundaries and make accommodations for others so they feel safe to live and "be", whenever and if ever they want.

Sidenote: I don't agree w/ the common version of "living authentically". My version: as long as you're not dead, you're living authentically. Life is in us + around us, and not something that "happens" to us. Events + our reactions to them shape our behaviour + are manifestations of authenticity.
