I took three weeks off (this week is my last one). First week was spent in France with my family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, nice and chill, but by the end I felt like I was ready to come home (even though I missed the setting and the scenery). Second week I spent it with my son whose birthday was on the starting Sunday. We had a lovely time and went to see Sonic 3 which restarted my [Sonic](/jardim/gaming/sonic-the-hedgehog/) hyperfixation and resulted in watching [Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog) all week with him, getting blue, orange, and red phone covers for my new phone, and completing [Sonic 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(1991_video_game)). This week, I'm going to be unpacking boxes as I moved a few months ago, making music, playing games, watching movies, and reading.

All in all, a great time off and so glad I took 3 weeks off.
