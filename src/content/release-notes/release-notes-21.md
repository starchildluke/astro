Funny how some people only started taking notice of fascism coming out of the US at the moment when Elon Musk did a Nazi salute—which had similarities to an old American gesture known as the [Bellamy salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamy_salute)—at an inauguration event. It's almost as if people only pay attention when there is something physically overt to pin it all to. Never mind the various marginalised groups calling these fascist behaviours previously and being shut down for sensationalism.

But anyway, here we are. What are you gonna do about it? You know, beyond telling people to vote. Because voting got us here too.
