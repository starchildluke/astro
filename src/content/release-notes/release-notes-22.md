I think we need to pump the breaks on suggesting that certain technologies are good for disabled people when a lot of those technologies carry inherent biases against them, are in the control of ableist providers, and aren't necessarily safe in all cases. How useful are they then?

Especially when, if things go wrong, those providers say "hey, we're not responsible for misuse". What if it's not misuse? Disabled people should not have to heavily scrutinise what to do or how to use technologies that are allegedly made to improve their lives; they have enough to deal with. If you've made something for a marginalised group, that has to have been the primary objective and focus. Nobody wants your second-hand consideration and it shows anyway.
