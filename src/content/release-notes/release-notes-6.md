We're all on a ball of rock, grass, water, with fire in the middle like some kind of elemental chimera (or a cheat [Pok√©mon](/jardim/pokemon/)). It's **much** smaller than a subatomic particle in proportion to the rest of the universe.

If we're lucky, we might get to live near to a century. But we (might) only get to do it once (unless you believe in reincarnation). With all that in mind, we're unfathomably small in an unfathomably large space of existence and we only have a finite time in it. So why wouldn't or shouldn't we have ideal lives and make it so that everyone else does? Why do we commend people who make life so unfathomably hard for others that they no longer want to be alive because of it?

All is not well.
