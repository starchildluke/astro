Originality is an overrated and misinterpreted concept. While I don't think we should remake what other people have done without changing anything, I also don't think we should stop making things if they "already exist". We can learn by doing and that fosters new approaches. So go make!

Reinventing the wheel is a common practice these days because companies kill off existing technologies so they can be in control of them AND claim they did it (see: Amazon vs. libraries and shopping). But if you make a wheel, it can teach you about all kinds of things and keep you asking "what if?"
