Today, I was asked if I could do a thing. I *nearly* said no but I decided I'd give it a try. I did better than I initially thought. The relief and joy it gave me was incredible. That's the power of Doing That Thing.

I think there are times when you could or should defer, either to someone else or until you're ready to do it yourself, but there are times to just go do it and in spite of myself and how I've been feeling lately, I'm proud of what I did today.
