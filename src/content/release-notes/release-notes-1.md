I don't like Novak Djokovic. The dislike was petty at first but after his comments about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/21/novak-djokovic-indian-wells-equal-prize-money-tennis">women</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/novak-djokovic-anti-vaccine-987003/">vaccinations</a>, his annoying heel turns during matches when the crowd doesn't cheer for him, and those cringey <a href="https://twitter.com/atptour/status/1298084307659943937">rib donation celebrations</a>, I feel vindicated. I'm also not pleased that he'll have the most grand slams at the end of his career. If Nadal had it, I wouldn't feel as bad (although his comments about <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/tennis/2018/6/13/17459962/rafael-nadal-equal-pay-tennis-male-models">women's prize money</a> are equally as bad) but <em>ugh</em>.
